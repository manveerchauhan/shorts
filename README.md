- Adds pattern interrupts for better retention
- Structures content for maximum engagement
- Scores scripts by viral potential (0-20 scale)

```bash
python shorts_workflow.py --action generate --max 10
```

### Full Pipeline Workflow

The `shorts_workflow.py` orchestrates the entire process:
- Content discovery â†’ Script generation â†’ Production preparation
- Keyword-based content search
- Performance tracking and analytics

## Content Best Practices

Based on analyzing thousands of successful Shorts:

1. **Hooks Matter**: The first 3 seconds determine success
   - Use questions, shocking statements, or unexpected claims
   - Visually show what you're talking about immediately

2. **Retention Optimization**:
   - Aim for 90%+ retention rate
   - Keep Shorts between 30-45 seconds
   - Use pattern interrupts to prevent scrolling

3. **Strategic Publishing**:
   - Start with one video per day
   - Increase frequency only after establishing momentum
   - Test different posting times to find optimal performance

4. **Analytics Focus**:
   - Swipe rate (aim for >80%)
   - Average percentage viewed (aim for >90%)
   - Retention graph (should remain flat)
