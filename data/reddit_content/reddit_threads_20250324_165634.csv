A community for the dumbass in all of us. We all have those moments where we do something ridiculously stupid. Share your stories and laugh along with the internet.
Rules
hover for details


1.  Use proper formatting: (1) All titles must start with TIFU. (2) All posts must have at least 750 characters in the body. (3) All posts must have a ""TL;DR summary"" at the end.



2.  Posts must be about you.  Today I fucked up.  Not your grandma, not some dude you saw in the newspaper.



3.  Must be your fault. Being a victim of something is not TIFU. Getting robbed, scammed, attacked, cheated on, etc, is not TIFU



4.  No overly vulgar posts.  Eg:  No pissing/​shitting your pants.  No incest/​rape​/​minors/​bestiality.  No death of animals.  No glorification of major crimes.



5.  Not a fuckup.  No humblebrags or stories that have zero consequences and don't go anywhere.  Eg ""tifu by sexy sex"".  Moderator discretion.



6.  Be civil.  No racism/​bigotry/​homophobia/​transphobia.  No personal attacks on other users, no name-calling.  No low-effort ""this didn't happen"" type comments.  READ MORE HERE



7.  No self promotion.  No making posts with the express purpose of promoting your business/video game/porn career. Even if not mentioned within the text of the post, alluding to links on your profile is not allowed. This covers implying you will set up a stream/public link/onlyfans in the future, having set up one in the past, or anything along the lines of ""upvote this comment if you want me to do this."" These examples are by no means comprehensive, just don't self promote.

7.  No self promotion.  No making posts with the express purpose of promoting your business/video game/porn career. Even if not mentioned within the text of the post, alluding to links on your profile is not allowed. This covers implying you will set up a stream/public link/onlyfans in the future, having set up one in the past, or anything along the lines of ""upvote this comment if you want me to do this.""

A catharsis for the frustrated moral philosopher in all of us, and a place to finally find out if you were wrong in a real-world argument that's been bothering you. Tell us about any non-violent conflict you have experienced; give us both sides of the story, and find out if you're right, or you're the asshole.
This is the sub to lay out your  actions and conflicts and get impartial judgment rendered against you.  Were you the asshole in that situation or not? Post should reflect real situations, and abide by the rules below.
After 18 hours, your post will be given a flair representing the final judgment on your matter.  This flair is determined by the subscribers who have both rendered judgment and voted on which judgment is best.  The power of the crowd will judge you.  If your top level comment has the highest number of upvotes in a thread, you will get a flair point. More details are listed in our FAQ.

YTA = You're the Asshole; 
YWBTA = You Would Be the Asshole;
NTA = Not the A-hole (and the other person is); 
YWNBTA = You Would Not be the Asshole  (and the other person would);
ESH = Everyone Sucks here;
NAH = No A-holes here; 
INFO = Not Enough Info 

Rules
1. Be Civil
Attack ideas, not people. The purpose of this sub is to determine and explain who is in the wrong, not to eviscerate anyone. Treat others with respect while helping them grow through outside perspectives. Derogatory or dehumanizing language, including insults, violate this rule.
This rule applies to everyone, even those not on Reddit. Don't insult others or get into prolonged spats in the comments. Don't lecture people about the rules (use reports).
Be respectful. Be nice. Don't be an asshole.
2. Voting Rules
Upvote posts that make for an interesting discussion. DON'T downvote if you think OP is an asshole. DON'T DOWNVOTE COMMENTS YOU DISAGREE WITH. Downvotes should be reserved for off-topic discussions or spam. Report harassing comments, don’t engage. 
Don't participate in threads you have found through crossposts and links outside of this subreddit. In this sub, your comment is a vote. Brigading/Vote manipulation is against Reddit site wide rules. Violations will earn a permanent ban.
3. Accept Your Judgment
This sub is here for the submitter to discover what everyone else thinks of the ethics or mores of a situation. It is not here to draw people into an argument you want to have, or to defend your position. If people start saying you were the asshole, do not take that as an invitation to debate them on the subject... accept the judgment and move on. If you have valid reason to think a commenter needs more information or misunderstood the facts of the conflict, you may give new information.
4. Never Delete An Active Discussion
DO NOT delete your submission once a discussion has begun. Your post must stay up for at least 48 hours. We encourage submitters to use throwaways to maintain their privacy, but deleting a discussion is unacceptable. Violators will be banned.
5. No Violence
Don't even mention violence.
The rule isn't about inciting or encouraging violence. It's about not mentioning.
Posts or comments that reference or mention violence in any manner do not belong here. 
Comments & even jokes about violence are not tolerated. Encouraging self-harm, suicide, ""bad karma,"" property damage, food tampering, or anything that wishes mental or physical pain on anyone, even hypothetically, is strictly prohibited. Violating this rule will result in a permanent ban.
6. How To Post
The TITLE of your submission must begin with the acronym AITA or WIBTA (would I be the asshole?), then a description of the situation.
Posts are limited to 3000 characters. Paragraphs are good; block text walls are bad. Format and punctuate your post reasonably. Be clear and concise. Don't link to screenshots or other subreddits. If you can't explain yourself in one post, without using external text pages, it does not belong here. Do not use someone else's account or a shared account.
7. Post Interpersonal Conflicts
Posts should be descriptions of recent interpersonal conflicts. Describe both sides in detail. Make it clear why you may be ""the asshole.""
Submissions must contain a real-life conflict between you and at least one other person. They should not be about feelings, opinions, or desires. If your conflict is with a larger demographic, an animal, someone online, a business, or a third party who’s irrelevant to the main question but thought what you did sucked, your post will be removed.
8. No Shitposts
Posts must be truthful and presented as fairly and accurately as possible. Posts must be written entirely by you and from your own point of view. Do not post on behalf of others, or from the point of view of another person in the story.
This is not a humor sub. This isn't a sub for copypastas, satire, overly embellished stories, AI generated content, or creative writing exercises.
Shitposting will result in a permanent ban.
9. Do Not Ask For Advice
This is NOT an advice sub. All submissions that ask for advice (instead of or in addition to judgment) will be removed. This sub is for arbitration.
You may include advice when you make your comments, but remember that your primary objective in commenting is to assign blame and pass judgment.
If a thread's focus becomes about advice instead of arbitration the thread may be removed regardless of the OP's intent.
10. Updates and META posts are restricted
Posts dedicated to discussing AITA should be directed to the monthly open forum. Any META posts will be removed & may result in a ban.
Update posts require approval.  This includes any post that references another post, including posting the other perspective. Review the update criteria for more info. Unapproved updates will result in a ban.
This is not a saga or diary sub. Excessive posting will result in a warning or ban.
11. No Partings/Relationship/Sex/Reproductive Autonomy Posts
AITA is not a relationship sub. We do not allow the following types of posts:

AITA for ghosting/cutting/reducing/denying contact with *anyone* (or not). 
AITA for liking/pursuing/dating/breaking up with someone (or not)
AITA for doing a sexual act (or not)
Reproductive decisions (including adopting/fostering children and delivery room conflicts)
Posts about cheating- including ""exposing"" someone's cheating (or not).
Or similar conflicts that only exist in romantic or sexual relationships.

12. This Is Not A Debate Sub
If judgment is primarily motivated by whether commenters agree with your stance on a broad issue it is not appropriate for this sub. This includes anything from politically motivated conflicts to innocuous issues like if cake is better than pie. If you're ultimately asking if it is okay to kick someone off your team for their sexual identity, stop talking to your friend because they vape, or any similar debate, your post will be removed.
No starting off topic debates about marginalized groups
13. No Revenge Stories
There are many subreddits for sharing tales of revenge—this is not one of them. This is a sub for providing feedback on interpersonal conflict, not for endorsing how you escalate a conflict. If you're here to tell us how you punished someone who totally had it coming, you're probably breaking this rule.
14. No Medical Conflicts
AITA is a platform for moral judgment, not medical advice. The life and death consequences of many medical conflicts are well outside of Reddit's paygrade. We do not allow posts where the central conflict is transmitting or contracting any communicable disease, or undergoing any kind of medical procedure.
15. Review the FAQ Before Participating
Subreddit rules are intended to provide a brief overview of our sub's content standards. Please ensure you read the FAQs for a detailed understanding of our community standards.

A catharsis for the frustrated moral philosopher in all of us, and a place to finally find out if you were wrong in a real-world argument that's been bothering you. Tell us about any non-violent conflict you have experienced; give us both sides of the story, and find out if you're right, or you're the asshole.
This is the sub to lay out your  actions and conflicts and get impartial judgment rendered against you.  Were you the asshole in that situation or not? Post should reflect real situations, and abide by the rules below.
After 18 hours, your post will be given a flair representing the final judgment on your matter.  This flair is determined by the subscribers who have both rendered judgment and voted on which judgment is best.  The power of the crowd will judge you.  If your top level comment has the highest number of upvotes in a thread, you will get a flair point. More details are listed in our FAQ.

If you have valid reason to think a commenter needs more information or misunderstood the facts of the conflict, you may give new information.
4. Never Delete An Active Discussion
DO NOT delete your submission once a discussion has begun. Your post must stay up for at least 48 hours. We encourage submitters to use throwaways to maintain their privacy, but deleting a discussion is unacceptable. Violators will be banned.
5. No Violence
Don't even mention violence.
The rule isn't about inciting or encouraging violence. It's about not mentioning.
Posts or comments that reference or mention violence in any manner do not belong here. 
Comments & even jokes about violence are not tolerated. Encouraging self-harm, suicide, ""bad karma,"" property damage, food tampering, or anything that wishes mental or physical pain on anyone, even hypothetically, is strictly prohibited. Violating this rule will result in a permanent ban.
6. How To Post
The TITLE of your submission must begin with the acronym AITA or WIBTA (would I be the asshole?), then a description of the situation.
Posts are limited to 3000 characters. Paragraphs are good; block text walls are bad. Format and punctuate your post reasonably. Be clear and concise. Don't link to screenshots or other subreddits. If you can't explain yourself in one post, without using external text pages, it does not belong here. Do not use someone else's account or a shared account.
7. Post Interpersonal Conflicts
Posts should be descriptions of recent interpersonal conflicts. Describe both sides in detail. Make it clear why you may be ""the asshole.""
Submissions must contain a real-life conflict between you and at least one other person. They should not be about feelings, opinions, or desires. If your conflict is with a larger demographic, an animal, someone online, a business, or a third party who’s irrelevant to the main question but thought what you did sucked, your post will be removed.
8. No Shitposts
Posts must be truthful and presented as fairly and accurately as possible. Posts must be written entirely by you and from your own point of view. Do not post on behalf of others, or from the point of view of another person in the story.
This is not a humor sub. This isn't a sub for copypastas, satire, overly embellished stories, AI generated content, or creative writing exercises.
Shitposting will result in a permanent ban.
9. Do Not Ask For Advice
This is NOT an advice sub. All submissions that ask for advice (instead of or in addition to judgment) will be removed. This sub is for arbitration.
You may include advice when you make your comments, but remember that your primary objective in commenting is to assign blame and pass judgment.
If a thread's focus becomes about advice instead of arbitration the thread may be removed regardless of the OP's intent.
10. Updates and META posts are restricted
Posts dedicated to discussing AITA should be directed to the monthly open forum. Any META posts will be removed & may result in a ban.
Update posts require approval.  This includes any post that references another post, including posting the other perspective. Review the update criteria for more info. Unapproved updates will result in a ban.

11. No Partings/Relationship/Sex/Reproductive Autonomy Posts

AITA for ghosting/cutting/reducing/denying contact with *anyone* (or not). 
AITA for liking/pursuing/dating/breaking up with someone (or not)
AITA for doing a sexual act (or not)
Reproductive decisions (including adopting/fostering children and delivery room conflicts)
Posts about cheating- including ""exposing"" someone's cheating (or not).
Or similar conflicts that only exist in romantic or sexual relationships.

12. This Is Not A Debate Sub
If judgment is primarily motivated by whether commenters agree with your stance on a broad issue it is not appropriate for this sub. This includes anything from politically motivated conflicts to innocuous issues like if cake is better than pie. If you're ultimately asking if it is okay to kick someone off your team for their sexual identity, stop talking to your friend because they vape, or any similar debate, your post will be removed.
No starting off topic debates about marginalized groups
13. No Revenge Stories
There are many subreddits for sharing tales of revenge—this is not one of them. This is a sub for providing feedback on interpersonal conflict, not for endorsing how you escalate a conflict. If you're here to tell us how you punished someone who totally had it coming, you're probably breaking this rule.
14. No Medical Conflicts
AITA is a platform for moral judgment, not medical advice. The life and death consequences of many medical conflicts are well outside of Reddit's paygrade. We do not allow posts where the central conflict is transmitting or contracting any communicable disease, or undergoing any kind of medical procedure.
15. Review the FAQ Before Participating
Subreddit rules are intended to provide a brief overview of our sub's content standards. Please ensure you read the FAQs for a detailed understanding of our community standards.

Posts are limited to 3000 characters. Paragraphs are good; block text walls are bad. Format and punctuate your post reasonably. Be clear and concise. Don't link to screenshots or other subreddits. If you can't explain yourself in one post, without using external text pages, it does not belong here. Do not use someone else's account or a shared account.
7. Post Interpersonal Conflicts
Posts should be descriptions of recent interpersonal conflicts. Describe both sides in detail. Make it clear why you may be ""the asshole.""
Submissions must contain a real-life conflict between you and at least one other person. They should not be about feelings, opinions, or desires. If your conflict is with a larger demographic, an animal, someone online, a business, or a third party who’s irrelevant to the main question but thought what you did sucked, your post will be removed.
8. No Shitposts
Posts must be truthful and presented as fairly and accurately as possible. Posts must be written entirely by you and from your own point of view. Do not post on behalf of others, or from the point of view of another person in the story.
This is not a humor sub. This isn't a sub for copypastas, satire, overly embellished stories, AI generated content, or creative writing exercises.
Shitposting will result in a permanent ban.
9. Do Not Ask For Advice
This is NOT an advice sub. All submissions that ask for advice (instead of or in addition to judgment) will be removed. This sub is for arbitration.
You may include advice when you make your comments, but remember that your primary objective in commenting is to assign blame and pass judgment.
If a thread's focus becomes about advice instead of arbitration the thread may be removed regardless of the OP's intent.
10. Updates and META posts are restricted
Posts dedicated to discussing AITA should be directed to the monthly open forum. Any META posts will be removed & may result in a ban.
Update posts require approval.  This includes any post that references another post, including posting the other perspective. Review the update criteria for more info. Unapproved updates will result in a ban.
This is not a saga or diary sub. Excessive posting will result in a warning or ban.
11. No Partings/Relationship/Sex/Reproductive Autonomy Posts
AITA is not a relationship sub. We do not allow the following types of posts:

AITA for ghosting/cutting/reducing/denying contact with *anyone* (or not). 
AITA for liking/pursuing/dating/breaking up with someone (or not)
AITA for doing a sexual act (or not)
Reproductive decisions (including adopting/fostering children and delivery room conflicts)
Posts about cheating- including ""exposing"" someone's cheating (or not).
Or similar conflicts that only exist in romantic or sexual relationships.

12. This Is Not A Debate Sub
If judgment is primarily motivated by whether commenters agree with your stance on a broad issue it is not appropriate for this sub. This includes anything from politically motivated conflicts to innocuous issues like if cake is better than pie. If you're ultimately asking if it is okay to kick someone off your team for their sexual identity, stop talking to your friend because they vape, or any similar debate, your post will be removed.
No starting off topic debates about marginalized groups
13. No Revenge Stories
There are many subreddits for sharing tales of revenge—this is not one of them. This is a sub for providing feedback on interpersonal conflict, not for endorsing how you escalate a conflict. If you're here to tell us how you punished someone who totally had it coming, you're probably breaking this rule.
14. No Medical Conflicts
AITA is a platform for moral judgment, not medical advice. The life and death consequences of many medical conflicts are well outside of Reddit's paygrade. We do not allow posts where the central conflict is transmitting or contracting any communicable disease, or undergoing any kind of medical procedure.

A catharsis for the frustrated moral philosopher in all of us, and a place to finally find out if you were wrong in a real-world argument that's been bothering you. Tell us about any non-violent conflict you have experienced; give us both sides of the story, and find out if you're right, or you're the asshole.
This is the sub to lay out your  actions and conflicts and get impartial judgment rendered against you.  Were you the asshole in that situation or not? Post should reflect real situations, and abide by the rules below.
After 18 hours, your post will be given a flair representing the final judgment on your matter.  This flair is determined by the subscribers who have both rendered judgment and voted on which judgment is best.  The power of the crowd will judge you.  If your top level comment has the highest number of upvotes in a thread, you will get a flair point. More details are listed in our FAQ.

4. Never Delete An Active Discussion
DO NOT delete your submission once a discussion has begun. Your post must stay up for at least 48 hours. We encourage submitters to use throwaways to maintain their privacy, but deleting a discussion is unacceptable. Violators will be banned.
5. No Violence
Don't even mention violence.
The rule isn't about inciting or encouraging violence. It's about not mentioning.
Posts or comments that reference or mention violence in any manner do not belong here. 
Comments & even jokes about violence are not tolerated. Encouraging self-harm, suicide, ""bad karma,"" property damage, food tampering, or anything that wishes mental or physical pain on anyone, even hypothetically, is strictly prohibited. Violating this rule will result in a permanent ban.
6. How To Post
The TITLE of your submission must begin with the acronym AITA or WIBTA (would I be the asshole?), then a description of the situation.
Posts are limited to 3000 characters. Paragraphs are good; block text walls are bad. Format and punctuate your post reasonably. Be clear and concise. Don't link to screenshots or other subreddits. If you can't explain yourself in one post, without using external text pages, it does not belong here. Do not use someone else's account or a shared account.
7. Post Interpersonal Conflicts
Posts should be descriptions of recent interpersonal conflicts. Describe both sides in detail. Make it clear why you may be ""the asshole.""
Submissions must contain a real-life conflict between you and at least one other person. They should not be about feelings, opinions, or desires. If your conflict is with a larger demographic, an animal, someone online, a business, or a third party who’s irrelevant to the main question but thought what you did sucked, your post will be removed.
8. No Shitposts
Posts must be truthful and presented as fairly and accurately as possible. Posts must be written entirely by you and from your own point of view. Do not post on behalf of others, or from the point of view of another person in the story.
This is not a humor sub. This isn't a sub for copypastas, satire, overly embellished stories, AI generated content, or creative writing exercises.
Shitposting will result in a permanent ban.
9. Do Not Ask For Advice
This is NOT an advice sub. All submissions that ask for advice (instead of or in addition to judgment) will be removed. This sub is for arbitration.
You may include advice when you make your comments, but remember that your primary objective in commenting is to assign blame and pass judgment.
If a thread's focus becomes about advice instead of arbitration the thread may be removed regardless of the OP's intent.
10. Updates and META posts are restricted
Posts dedicated to discussing AITA should be directed to the monthly open forum. Any META posts will be removed & may result in a ban.

AITA for ghosting/cutting/reducing/denying contact with *anyone* (or not). 
AITA for liking/pursuing/dating/breaking up with someone (or not)
AITA for doing a sexual act (or not)
Reproductive decisions (including adopting/fostering children and delivery room conflicts)
Posts about cheating- including ""exposing"" someone's cheating (or not).
Or similar conflicts that only exist in romantic or sexual relationships.

12. This Is Not A Debate Sub
If judgment is primarily motivated by whether commenters agree with your stance on a broad issue it is not appropriate for this sub. This includes anything from politically motivated conflicts to innocuous issues like if cake is better than pie. If you're ultimately asking if it is okay to kick someone off your team for their sexual identity, stop talking to your friend because they vape, or any similar debate, your post will be removed.
No starting off topic debates about marginalized groups
13. No Revenge Stories
There are many subreddits for sharing tales of revenge—this is not one of them. This is a sub for providing feedback on interpersonal conflict, not for endorsing how you escalate a conflict. If you're here to tell us how you punished someone who totally had it coming, you're probably breaking this rule.
14. No Medical Conflicts
AITA is a platform for moral judgment, not medical advice. The life and death consequences of many medical conflicts are well outside of Reddit's paygrade. We do not allow posts where the central conflict is transmitting or contracting any communicable disease, or undergoing any kind of medical procedure.
15. Review the FAQ Before Participating
Subreddit rules are intended to provide a brief overview of our sub's content standards. Please ensure you read the FAQs for a detailed understanding of our community standards.

Posts must be truthful and presented as fairly and accurately as possible. Posts must be written entirely by you and from your own point of view. Do not post on behalf of others, or from the point of view of another person in the story.
This is not a humor sub. This isn't a sub for copypastas, satire, overly embellished stories, AI generated content, or creative writing exercises.
Shitposting will result in a permanent ban.
9. Do Not Ask For Advice
This is NOT an advice sub. All submissions that ask for advice (instead of or in addition to judgment) will be removed. This sub is for arbitration.
You may include advice when you make your comments, but remember that your primary objective in commenting is to assign blame and pass judgment.
If a thread's focus becomes about advice instead of arbitration the thread may be removed regardless of the OP's intent.
10. Updates and META posts are restricted
Posts dedicated to discussing AITA should be directed to the monthly open forum. Any META posts will be removed & may result in a ban.
Update posts require approval.  This includes any post that references another post, including posting the other perspective. Review the update criteria for more info. Unapproved updates will result in a ban.
This is not a saga or diary sub. Excessive posting will result in a warning or ban.
11. No Partings/Relationship/Sex/Reproductive Autonomy Posts
AITA is not a relationship sub. We do not allow the following types of posts:

AITA for ghosting/cutting/reducing/denying contact with *anyone* (or not). 
AITA for liking/pursuing/dating/breaking up with someone (or not)
AITA for doing a sexual act (or not)
Reproductive decisions (including adopting/fostering children and delivery room conflicts)
Posts about cheating- including ""exposing"" someone's cheating (or not).
Or similar conflicts that only exist in romantic or sexual relationships.

12. This Is Not A Debate Sub
If judgment is primarily motivated by whether commenters agree with your stance on a broad issue it is not appropriate for this sub. This includes anything from politically motivated conflicts to innocuous issues like if cake is better than pie. If you're ultimately asking if it is okay to kick someone off your team for their sexual identity, stop talking to your friend because they vape, or any similar debate, your post will be removed.
No starting off topic debates about marginalized groups
13. No Revenge Stories
There are many subreddits for sharing tales of revenge—this is not one of them. This is a sub for providing feedback on interpersonal conflict, not for endorsing how you escalate a conflict. If you're here to tell us how you punished someone who totally had it coming, you're probably breaking this rule.
14. No Medical Conflicts
AITA is a platform for moral judgment, not medical advice. The life and death consequences of many medical conflicts are well outside of Reddit's paygrade. We do not allow posts where the central conflict is transmitting or contracting any communicable disease, or undergoing any kind of medical procedure.

A catharsis for the frustrated moral philosopher in all of us, and a place to finally find out if you were wrong in a real-world argument that's been bothering you. Tell us about any non-violent conflict you have experienced; give us both sides of the story, and find out if you're right, or you're the asshole.
This is the sub to lay out your  actions and conflicts and get impartial judgment rendered against you.  Were you the asshole in that situation or not? Post should reflect real situations, and abide by the rules below.
After 18 hours, your post will be given a flair representing the final judgment on your matter.  This flair is determined by the subscribers who have both rendered judgment and voted on which judgment is best.  The power of the crowd will judge you.  If your top level comment has the highest number of upvotes in a thread, you will get a flair point. More details are listed in our FAQ.

4. Never Delete An Active Discussion
DO NOT delete your submission once a discussion has begun. Your post must stay up for at least 48 hours. We encourage submitters to use throwaways to maintain their privacy, but deleting a discussion is unacceptable. Violators will be banned.
5. No Violence
Don't even mention violence.
The rule isn't about inciting or encouraging violence. It's about not mentioning.
Posts or comments that reference or mention violence in any manner do not belong here. 
Comments & even jokes about violence are not tolerated. Encouraging self-harm, suicide, ""bad karma,"" property damage, food tampering, or anything that wishes mental or physical pain on anyone, even hypothetically, is strictly prohibited. Violating this rule will result in a permanent ban.
6. How To Post
The TITLE of your submission must begin with the acronym AITA or WIBTA (would I be the asshole?), then a description of the situation.
Posts are limited to 3000 characters. Paragraphs are good; block text walls are bad. Format and punctuate your post reasonably. Be clear and concise. Don't link to screenshots or other subreddits. If you can't explain yourself in one post, without using external text pages, it does not belong here. Do not use someone else's account or a shared account.
7. Post Interpersonal Conflicts
Posts should be descriptions of recent interpersonal conflicts. Describe both sides in detail. Make it clear why you may be ""the asshole.""
Submissions must contain a real-life conflict between you and at least one other person. They should not be about feelings, opinions, or desires. If your conflict is with a larger demographic, an animal, someone online, a business, or a third party who’s irrelevant to the main question but thought what you did sucked, your post will be removed.
8. No Shitposts
Posts must be truthful and presented as fairly and accurately as possible. Posts must be written entirely by you and from your own point of view. Do not post on behalf of others, or from the point of view of another person in the story.
This is not a humor sub. This isn't a sub for copypastas, satire, overly embellished stories, AI generated content, or creative writing exercises.
Shitposting will result in a permanent ban.
9. Do Not Ask For Advice
This is NOT an advice sub. All submissions that ask for advice (instead of or in addition to judgment) will be removed. This sub is for arbitration.
You may include advice when you make your comments, but remember that your primary objective in commenting is to assign blame and pass judgment.
If a thread's focus becomes about advice instead of arbitration the thread may be removed regardless of the OP's intent.

AITA for ghosting/cutting/reducing/denying contact with *anyone* (or not). 
AITA for liking/pursuing/dating/breaking up with someone (or not)
AITA for doing a sexual act (or not)
Reproductive decisions (including adopting/fostering children and delivery room conflicts)
Posts about cheating- including ""exposing"" someone's cheating (or not).
Or similar conflicts that only exist in romantic or sexual relationships.

12. This Is Not A Debate Sub
If judgment is primarily motivated by whether commenters agree with your stance on a broad issue it is not appropriate for this sub. This includes anything from politically motivated conflicts to innocuous issues like if cake is better than pie. If you're ultimately asking if it is okay to kick someone off your team for their sexual identity, stop talking to your friend because they vape, or any similar debate, your post will be removed.
No starting off topic debates about marginalized groups
13. No Revenge Stories
There are many subreddits for sharing tales of revenge—this is not one of them. This is a sub for providing feedback on interpersonal conflict, not for endorsing how you escalate a conflict. If you're here to tell us how you punished someone who totally had it coming, you're probably breaking this rule.
14. No Medical Conflicts
AITA is a platform for moral judgment, not medical advice. The life and death consequences of many medical conflicts are well outside of Reddit's paygrade. We do not allow posts where the central conflict is transmitting or contracting any communicable disease, or undergoing any kind of medical procedure.
15. Review the FAQ Before Participating
Subreddit rules are intended to provide a brief overview of our sub's content standards. Please ensure you read the FAQs for a detailed understanding of our community standards.

A catharsis for the frustrated moral philosopher in all of us, and a place to finally find out if you were wrong in a real-world argument that's been bothering you. Tell us about any non-violent conflict you have experienced; give us both sides of the story, and find out if you're right, or you're the asshole.
This is the sub to lay out your  actions and conflicts and get impartial judgment rendered against you.  Were you the asshole in that situation or not? Post should reflect real situations, and abide by the rules below.
After 18 hours, your post will be given a flair representing the final judgment on your matter.  This flair is determined by the subscribers who have both rendered judgment and voted on which judgment is best.  The power of the crowd will judge you.  If your top level comment has the highest number of upvotes in a thread, you will get a flair point. More details are listed in our FAQ.

Posts dedicated to discussing AITA should be directed to the monthly open forum. Any META posts will be removed & may result in a ban.
Update posts require approval.  This includes any post that references another post, including posting the other perspective. Review the update criteria for more info. Unapproved updates will result in a ban.
This is not a saga or diary sub. Excessive posting will result in a warning or ban.
11. No Partings/Relationship/Sex/Reproductive Autonomy Posts
AITA is not a relationship sub. We do not allow the following types of posts:

AITA for ghosting/cutting/reducing/denying contact with *anyone* (or not). 
AITA for liking/pursuing/dating/breaking up with someone (or not)
AITA for doing a sexual act (or not)
Reproductive decisions (including adopting/fostering children and delivery room conflicts)
Posts about cheating- including ""exposing"" someone's cheating (or not).
Or similar conflicts that only exist in romantic or sexual relationships.

12. This Is Not A Debate Sub
If judgment is primarily motivated by whether commenters agree with your stance on a broad issue it is not appropriate for this sub. This includes anything from politically motivated conflicts to innocuous issues like if cake is better than pie. If you're ultimately asking if it is okay to kick someone off your team for their sexual identity, stop talking to your friend because they vape, or any similar debate, your post will be removed.
No starting off topic debates about marginalized groups
13. No Revenge Stories
There are many subreddits for sharing tales of revenge—this is not one of them. This is a sub for providing feedback on interpersonal conflict, not for endorsing how you escalate a conflict. If you're here to tell us how you punished someone who totally had it coming, you're probably breaking this rule.
14. No Medical Conflicts
AITA is a platform for moral judgment, not medical advice. The life and death consequences of many medical conflicts are well outside of Reddit's paygrade. We do not allow posts where the central conflict is transmitting or contracting any communicable disease, or undergoing any kind of medical procedure.

A catharsis for the frustrated moral philosopher in all of us, and a place to finally find out if you were wrong in a real-world argument that's been bothering you. Tell us about any non-violent conflict you have experienced; give us both sides of the story, and find out if you're right, or you're the asshole.
This is the sub to lay out your  actions and conflicts and get impartial judgment rendered against you.  Were you the asshole in that situation or not? Post should reflect real situations, and abide by the rules below.
After 18 hours, your post will be given a flair representing the final judgment on your matter.  This flair is determined by the subscribers who have both rendered judgment and voted on which judgment is best.  The power of the crowd will judge you.  If your top level comment has the highest number of upvotes in a thread, you will get a flair point. More details are listed in our FAQ.

INFO = Not Enough Info 

Rules
1. Be Civil
Attack ideas, not people. The purpose of this sub is to determine and explain who is in the wrong, not to eviscerate anyone. Treat others with respect while helping them grow through outside perspectives. Derogatory or dehumanizing language, including insults, violate this rule.
This rule applies to everyone, even those not on Reddit. Don't insult others or get into prolonged spats in the comments. Don't lecture people about the rules (use reports).
Be respectful. Be nice. Don't be an asshole.
2. Voting Rules
Upvote posts that make for an interesting discussion. DON'T downvote if you think OP is an asshole. DON'T DOWNVOTE COMMENTS YOU DISAGREE WITH. Downvotes should be reserved for off-topic discussions or spam. Report harassing comments, don’t engage. 
Don't participate in threads you have found through crossposts and links outside of this subreddit. In this sub, your comment is a vote. Brigading/Vote manipulation is against Reddit site wide rules. Violations will earn a permanent ban.
3. Accept Your Judgment
This sub is here for the submitter to discover what everyone else thinks of the ethics or mores of a situation. It is not here to draw people into an argument you want to have, or to defend your position. If people start saying you were the asshole, do not take that as an invitation to debate them on the subject... accept the judgment and move on. If you have valid reason to think a commenter needs more information or misunderstood the facts of the conflict, you may give new information.
4. Never Delete An Active Discussion
DO NOT delete your submission once a discussion has begun. Your post must stay up for at least 48 hours. We encourage submitters to use throwaways to maintain their privacy, but deleting a discussion is unacceptable. Violators will be banned.
5. No Violence
Don't even mention violence.
The rule isn't about inciting or encouraging violence. It's about not mentioning.
Posts or comments that reference or mention violence in any manner do not belong here. 
Comments & even jokes about violence are not tolerated. Encouraging self-harm, suicide, ""bad karma,"" property damage, food tampering, or anything that wishes mental or physical pain on anyone, even hypothetically, is strictly prohibited. Violating this rule will result in a permanent ban.
6. How To Post
The TITLE of your submission must begin with the acronym AITA or WIBTA (would I be the asshole?), then a description of the situation.
Posts are limited to 3000 characters. Paragraphs are good; block text walls are bad. Format and punctuate your post reasonably. Be clear and concise. Don't link to screenshots or other subreddits. If you can't explain yourself in one post, without using external text pages, it does not belong here. Do not use someone else's account or a shared account.
7. Post Interpersonal Conflicts
Posts should be descriptions of recent interpersonal conflicts. Describe both sides in detail. Make it clear why you may be ""the asshole.""
Submissions must contain a real-life conflict between you and at least one other person. They should not be about feelings, opinions, or desires. If your conflict is with a larger demographic, an animal, someone online, a business, or a third party who’s irrelevant to the main question but thought what you did sucked, your post will be removed.
8. No Shitposts
Posts must be truthful and presented as fairly and accurately as possible. Posts must be written entirely by you and from your own point of view. Do not post on behalf of others, or from the point of view of another person in the story.
This is not a humor sub. This isn't a sub for copypastas, satire, overly embellished stories, AI generated content, or creative writing exercises.
Shitposting will result in a permanent ban.
9. Do Not Ask For Advice
This is NOT an advice sub. All submissions that ask for advice (instead of or in addition to judgment) will be removed. This sub is for arbitration.
You may include advice when you make your comments, but remember that your primary objective in commenting is to assign blame and pass judgment.
If a thread's focus becomes about advice instead of arbitration the thread may be removed regardless of the OP's intent.
10. Updates and META posts are restricted
Posts dedicated to discussing AITA should be directed to the monthly open forum. Any META posts will be removed & may result in a ban.
Update posts require approval.  This includes any post that references another post, including posting the other perspective. Review the update criteria for more info. Unapproved updates will result in a ban.
This is not a saga or diary sub. Excessive posting will result in a warning or ban.
11. No Partings/Relationship/Sex/Reproductive Autonomy Posts
AITA is not a relationship sub. We do not allow the following types of posts:

AITA for ghosting/cutting/reducing/denying contact with *anyone* (or not). 
AITA for liking/pursuing/dating/breaking up with someone (or not)
AITA for doing a sexual act (or not)
Reproductive decisions (including adopting/fostering children and delivery room conflicts)
Posts about cheating- including ""exposing"" someone's cheating (or not).
Or similar conflicts that only exist in romantic or sexual relationships.

12. This Is Not A Debate Sub
If judgment is primarily motivated by whether commenters agree with your stance on a broad issue it is not appropriate for this sub. This includes anything from politically motivated conflicts to innocuous issues like if cake is better than pie. If you're ultimately asking if it is okay to kick someone off your team for their sexual identity, stop talking to your friend because they vape, or any similar debate, your post will be removed.
No starting off topic debates about marginalized groups
13. No Revenge Stories
There are many subreddits for sharing tales of revenge—this is not one of them. This is a sub for providing feedback on interpersonal conflict, not for endorsing how you escalate a conflict. If you're here to tell us how you punished someone who totally had it coming, you're probably breaking this rule.
14. No Medical Conflicts
AITA is a platform for moral judgment, not medical advice. The life and death consequences of many medical conflicts are well outside of Reddit's paygrade. We do not allow posts where the central conflict is transmitting or contracting any communicable disease, or undergoing any kind of medical procedure.
15. Review the FAQ Before Participating
Subreddit rules are intended to provide a brief overview of our sub's content standards. Please ensure you read the FAQs for a detailed understanding of our community standards.

Normal Rediquette applies

Malicious compliance is the act of intentionally inflicting harm by strictly following orders or rules, knowing that compliance with the orders or rules will not have the intended result. The term usually implies the following of an order in such a way that ignores the order or rules's intent but follows its letter. It is usually done to injure or harm while maintaining a sense of legitimacy.
While writing your stories, please make sure to explain why the result is something you'd like to happen. If you can't figure out why you're so happy about the situation, just make sure it's clear that you don't like the person, company, or group that suffered as a result of your flawless victory. Trust me, stories that explain that their boss is a dick or the snotty mom from down the street had it coming are just much more enjoyable to read.
Rules:

All posts must be a story that must contain some form of malicious compliance. Malicious is interpreted broadly, but posts where people do not comply with rules will be removed. Update posts must link to the previous post on this subreddit and are subject to moderator approval.
No stories involving the following banned elements: Death of anyone, Historical Figures, Fantasy Creatures, Schools (school employees and university students are okay), Complier involuntary bodily functions, or Malicious Compliance with subreddit rules. Also do not thank or reference Youtubers/Influencers. Please ask the moderators if you’re unsure.
Don't question the validity of a story. It's much more fun if we give people the benefit of the doubt.
Original content only. If it’s not yours then do not post it and do not comment it. You may link to where the owner posted it if you can find it. You do not own the words of other people. You do not own random photos you found online. You do not own Calvin & Hobbes.
Comments must forward the discussion. A comment that only insults without prompting further discussion will be removed. Those requesting a user be banned who breaks no rules may be banned themselves at mod discretion.
It must be clear that whoever is complying is doing so intentionally. Animals and malfunctioning computers are not allowed. Stories involving children must be from the child’s perspective (your story or a story someone told you from their childhood about something they did) or an adult maliciously complying in a way that involves a child (such as a parent using a loophole to skirt a school rule).
Include the fallout. Wait until expected fallout has occurred before sharing. You must also have maliciously complied, not just thought about how you want to. If you’re expecting to have an update, wait until that later date. If additional fallout occurs later, you may be able to update, but it should be a surprise.
No Acronyms As Names. Don't make up acronyms for your post. Don't use acronyms from another subreddit. Generally known acronyms are fine. Use industry terms if you like, but explain what they mean.

We may take any action, including banning, for the first infraction of any rule!

No stories involving the following banned elements: Death of anyone, Historical Figures, Fantasy Creatures, Schools (school employees and university students are okay), Complier involuntary bodily functions, or Malicious Compliance with subreddit rules. Also do not thank or reference Youtubers/Influencers. Please ask the moderators if you’re unsure.
Don't question the validity of a story. It's much more fun if we give people the benefit of the doubt.
Original content only. If it’s not yours then do not post it and do not comment it. You may link to where the owner posted it if you can find it. You do not own the words of other people. You do not own random photos you found online. You do not own Calvin & Hobbes.
Comments must forward the discussion. A comment that only insults without prompting further discussion will be removed. Those requesting a user be banned who breaks no rules may be banned themselves at mod discretion.
It must be clear that whoever is complying is doing so intentionally. Animals and malfunctioning computers are not allowed. Stories involving children must be from the child’s perspective (your story or a story someone told you from their childhood about something they did) or an adult maliciously complying in a way that involves a child (such as a parent using a loophole to skirt a school rule).
Include the fallout. Wait until expected fallout has occurred before sharing. You must also have maliciously complied, not just thought about how you want to. If you’re expecting to have an update, wait until that later date. If additional fallout occurs later, you may be able to update, but it should be a surprise.
No Acronyms As Names. Don't make up acronyms for your post. Don't use acronyms from another subreddit. Generally known acronyms are fine. Use industry terms if you like, but explain what they mean.

We may take any action, including banning, for the first infraction of any rule!

Malicious compliance is the act of intentionally inflicting harm by strictly following orders or rules, knowing that compliance with the orders or rules will not have the intended result. The term usually implies the following of an order in such a way that ignores the order or rules's intent but follows its letter. It is usually done to injure or harm while maintaining a sense of legitimacy.
While writing your stories, please make sure to explain why the result is something you'd like to happen. If you can't figure out why you're so happy about the situation, just make sure it's clear that you don't like the person, company, or group that suffered as a result of your flawless victory. Trust me, stories that explain that their boss is a dick or the snotty mom from down the street had it coming are just much more enjoyable to read.

Stories involving children must be from the child’s perspective (your story or a story someone told you from their childhood about something they did) or an adult maliciously complying in a way that involves a child (such as a parent using a loophole to skirt a school rule).
Include the fallout. Wait until expected fallout has occurred before sharing. You must also have maliciously complied, not just thought about how you want to. If you’re expecting to have an update, wait until that later date. If additional fallout occurs later, you may be able to update, but it should be a surprise.

Malicious compliance is the act of intentionally inflicting harm by strictly following orders or rules, knowing that compliance with the orders or rules will not have the intended result. The term usually implies the following of an order in such a way that ignores the order or rules's intent but follows its letter. It is usually done to injure or harm while maintaining a sense of legitimacy.
While writing your stories, please make sure to explain why the result is something you'd like to happen. If you can't figure out why you're so happy about the situation, just make sure it's clear that you don't like the person, company, or group that suffered as a result of your flawless victory. Trust me, stories that explain that their boss is a dick or the snotty mom from down the street had it coming are just much more enjoyable to read.
Rules:

All posts must be a story that must contain some form of malicious compliance. Malicious is interpreted broadly, but posts where people do not comply with rules will be removed. Update posts must link to the previous post on this subreddit and are subject to moderator approval.
No stories involving the following banned elements: Death of anyone, Historical Figures, Fantasy Creatures, Schools (school employees and university students are okay), Complier involuntary bodily functions, or Malicious Compliance with subreddit rules. Also do not thank or reference Youtubers/Influencers. Please ask the moderators if you’re unsure.
Don't question the validity of a story. It's much more fun if we give people the benefit of the doubt.
Original content only. If it’s not yours then do not post it and do not comment it. You may link to where the owner posted it if you can find it. You do not own the words of other people. You do not own random photos you found online. You do not own Calvin & Hobbes.

Post it here! 
Rules:

Your story should be about getting back at someone who wronged you in generally an interesting and/or funny way. In order for your story to be pro revenge, it should involve you going out of your way and going above and beyond to get revenge. If that isn't the case with your story, it may be better suited for another revenge subreddit such as /r/pettyrevenge or /r/maliciouscompliance.

Only revenge stories are allowed. If you have an idea for the subreddit, please message the mods to submit your suggestions. Meta posts may be allowed, but need to be cleared by the mods before posting.
Not sure if your story is pro or not?  See What is Pro Revenge?

The story does not have to be about you; it can be about someone you know or even something you saw somewhere else. However, stories must be feasibly possible. If the mods deem your post to be clearly fictional, it may be removed.
No posts asking for ideas of revenge; all posts should contain a full revenge story. Update posts are only allowed if they include significant additional revenge; minor updates should go in the original post or a comment linked from original post. Moderators reserve the right to remove update posts if they are deemed excessive/not relevant.  
Do not post any personal information, real or fake, such as full names, phone numbers, addresses, facebook/twitter pages or email addresses etc. Posting personal information will result in an immediate ban.
Cross posts (x-posts) are welcome but please copy the text here, instead of providing a link. You may link to videos but your post will still need to describe the revenge (i.e. you can't just post the video link and nothing else).
Please, nothing too serious. No felonies or other nonacceptable/illegal stories. 
Bots and bot-like behavior are not allowed. 
Please be considerate in your posts and comments. No racism, sexism, personal attacks against other redditors etc. The mods may remove distasteful comments.
This sub is not your personal army. Do not attempt to use this sub to gang up on or promote a person, cause, or group.
Do not post comments calling stories fake without backing up your claims. You are more than welcome to point out inconsistencies or express your skepticism, but simply saying 'It didn't happen', 'fake', 'that happened', and the like do not contribute to the sub and create a toxic atmosphere.  
No acronyms or initials for names. Please assign your story characters fake names (first name only per Rule 4) or use titles like 'EntitledIdiot'.

The mods reserve the right to remove content at their discretion.
If you have any questions please feel free to message the mods.
