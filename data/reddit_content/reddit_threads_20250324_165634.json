        "selftext": "Welcome to r/AmITheAsshole!\nA catharsis for the frustrated moral philosopher in all of us, and a place to finally find out if you were wrong in a real-world argument that's been bothering you. Tell us about any non-violent conflict you have experienced; give us both sides of the story, and find out if you're right, or you're the asshole.\nThis is the sub to lay out your  actions and conflicts and get impartial judgment rendered against you.  Were you the asshole in that situation or not? Post should reflect real situations, and abide by the rules below.\nAfter 18 hours, your post will be given a flair representing the final judgment on your matter.  This flair is determined by the subscribers who have both rendered judgment and voted on which judgment is best.  The power of the crowd will judge you.  If your top level comment has the highest number of upvotes in a thread, you will get a flair point. More details are listed in our FAQ.\n\nImportant Links\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nHow To Post\nVisit our sister subreddit /r/AmItheButtface/ for posts about fiction or relationships, and basically anything that we don't allow here! /r/AmItheCloaca for posts from animals and /r/AmItheGrasshole for all your lawncare conflicts!\nSee our Best Of \"Most Controversial\" at /r/AITAFiltered \nLooking for some Regional Assholes? /r/AkoBaYungGago/ /r/BenIkDeEikel /r/BinIchDasArschloch /r/EuSouOBabaca /r/suisjeletroudeballe \nSee our resources for those in an unhealthy or abusive relationship and resources for members of the LGBTQIA+ community that might need help or support\nhttps://al-anon.org/ and http://www.teen-anon.com/\nhttps://smartrecovery.org/\nhttps://www.childhelp.org/\n\n\nVoting Guide\nIn your top level comment be sure to include one abbreviation for your judgment, i.e.\nYTA = You're the Asshole; \nYWBTA = You Would Be the Asshole;\nNTA = Not the A-hole (and the other person is); \nYWNBTA = You Would Not be the Asshole  (and the other person would);\nESH = Everyone Sucks here;\nNAH = No A-holes here; \nINFO = Not Enough Info \n\nRules\n1. Be Civil\nAttack ideas, not people. The purpose of this sub is to determine and explain who is in the wrong, not to eviscerate anyone. Treat others with respect while helping them grow through outside perspectives. Derogatory or dehumanizing language, including insults, violate this rule.\nThis rule applies to everyone, even those not on Reddit. Don't insult others or get into prolonged spats in the comments. Don't lecture people about the rules (use reports).\nBe respectful. Be nice. Don't be an asshole.\n2. Voting Rules\nUpvote posts that make for an interesting discussion. DON'T downvote if you think OP is an asshole. DON'T DOWNVOTE COMMENTS YOU DISAGREE WITH. Downvotes should be reserved for off-topic discussions or spam. Report harassing comments, don’t engage. \nDon't participate in threads you have found through crossposts and links outside of this subreddit. In this sub, your comment is a vote. Brigading/Vote manipulation is against Reddit site wide rules. Violations will earn a permanent ban.\n3. Accept Your Judgment\nThis sub is here for the submitter to discover what everyone else thinks of the ethics or mores of a situation. It is not here to draw people into an argument you want to have, or to defend your position. If people start saying you were the asshole, do not take that as an invitation to debate them on the subject... accept the judgment and move on. If you have valid reason to think a commenter needs more information or misunderstood the facts of the conflict, you may give new information.\n4. Never Delete An Active Discussion\nDO NOT delete your submission once a discussion has begun. Your post must stay up for at least 48 hours. We encourage submitters to use throwaways to maintain their privacy, but deleting a discussion is unacceptable. Violators will be banned.\n5. No Violence\nDon't even mention violence.\nThe rule isn't about inciting or encouraging violence. It's about not mentioning.\nPosts or comments that reference or mention violence in any manner do not belong here. \nComments & even jokes about violence are not tolerated. Encouraging self-harm, suicide, \"bad karma,\" property damage, food tampering, or anything that wishes mental or physical pain on anyone, even hypothetically, is strictly prohibited. Violating this rule will result in a permanent ban.\n6. How To Post\nThe TITLE of your submission must begin with the acronym AITA or WIBTA (would I be the asshole?), then a description of the situation.\nPosts are limited to 3000 characters. Paragraphs are good; block text walls are bad. Format and punctuate your post reasonably. Be clear and concise. Don't link to screenshots or other subreddits. If you can't explain yourself in one post, without using external text pages, it does not belong here. Do not use someone else's account or a shared account.\n7. Post Interpersonal Conflicts\nPosts should be descriptions of recent interpersonal conflicts. Describe both sides in detail. Make it clear why you may be \"the asshole.\"\nSubmissions must contain a real-life conflict between you and at least one other person. They should not be about feelings, opinions, or desires. If your conflict is with a larger demographic, an animal, someone online, a business, or a third party who’s irrelevant to the main question but thought what you did sucked, your post will be removed.\n8. No Shitposts\nPosts must be truthful and presented as fairly and accurately as possible. Posts must be written entirely by you and from your own point of view. Do not post on behalf of others, or from the point of view of another person in the story.\nThis is not a humor sub. This isn't a sub for copypastas, satire, overly embellished stories, AI generated content, or creative writing exercises.\nShitposting will result in a permanent ban.\n9. Do Not Ask For Advice\nThis is NOT an advice sub. All submissions that ask for advice (instead of or in addition to judgment) will be removed. This sub is for arbitration.\nYou may include advice when you make your comments, but remember that your primary objective in commenting is to assign blame and pass judgment.\nIf a thread's focus becomes about advice instead of arbitration the thread may be removed regardless of the OP's intent.\n10. Updates and META posts are restricted\nPosts dedicated to discussing AITA should be directed to the monthly open forum. Any META posts will be removed & may result in a ban.\nUpdate posts require approval.  This includes any post that references another post, including posting the other perspective. Review the update criteria for more info. Unapproved updates will result in a ban.\nThis is not a saga or diary sub. Excessive posting will result in a warning or ban.\n11. No Partings/Relationship/Sex/Reproductive Autonomy Posts\nAITA is not a relationship sub. We do not allow the following types of posts:\n\nAITA for ghosting/cutting/reducing/denying contact with *anyone* (or not). \nAITA for liking/pursuing/dating/breaking up with someone (or not)\nAITA for doing a sexual act (or not)\nReproductive decisions (including adopting/fostering children and delivery room conflicts)\nPosts about cheating- including \"exposing\" someone's cheating (or not).\nOr similar conflicts that only exist in romantic or sexual relationships.\n\n12. This Is Not A Debate Sub\nIf judgment is primarily motivated by whether commenters agree with your stance on a broad issue it is not appropriate for this sub. This includes anything from politically motivated conflicts to innocuous issues like if cake is better than pie. If you're ultimately asking if it is okay to kick someone off your team for their sexual identity, stop talking to your friend because they vape, or any similar debate, your post will be removed.\nNo starting off topic debates about marginalized groups\n13. No Revenge Stories\nThere are many subreddits for sharing tales of revenge—this is not one of them. This is a sub for providing feedback on interpersonal conflict, not for endorsing how you escalate a conflict. If you're here to tell us how you punished someone who totally had it coming, you're probably breaking this rule.\n14. No Medical Conflicts\nAITA is a platform for moral judgment, not medical advice. The life and death consequences of many medical conflicts are well outside of Reddit's paygrade.

Be Civil\nAttack ideas, not people. The purpose of this sub is to determine and explain who is in the wrong, not to eviscerate anyone. Treat others with respect while helping them grow through outside perspectives. Derogatory or dehumanizing language, including insults, violate this rule.\nThis rule applies to everyone, even those not on Reddit. Don't insult others or get into prolonged spats in the comments. Don't lecture people about the rules (use reports).\nBe respectful. Be nice. Don't be an asshole.\n2. Voting Rules\nUpvote posts that make for an interesting discussion. DON'T downvote if you think OP is an asshole. DON'T DOWNVOTE COMMENTS YOU DISAGREE WITH. Downvotes should be reserved for off-topic discussions or spam. Report harassing comments, don’t engage. \nDon't participate in threads you have found through crossposts and links outside of this subreddit. In this sub, your comment is a vote. Brigading/Vote manipulation is against Reddit site wide rules. Violations will earn a permanent ban.\n3. Accept Your Judgment\nThis sub is here for the submitter to discover what everyone else thinks of the ethics or mores of a situation. It is not here to draw people into an argument you want to have, or to defend your position. If people start saying you were the asshole, do not take that as an invitation to debate them on the subject... accept the judgment and move on. If you have valid reason to think a commenter needs more information or misunderstood the facts of the conflict, you may give new information.\n4. Never Delete An Active Discussion\nDO NOT delete your submission once a discussion has begun. Your post must stay up for at least 48 hours. We encourage submitters to use throwaways to maintain their privacy, but deleting a discussion is unacceptable. Violators will be banned.\n5. No Violence\nDon't even mention violence.\nThe rule isn't about inciting or encouraging violence. It's about not mentioning.\nPosts or comments that reference or mention violence in any manner do not belong here. \nComments & even jokes about violence are not tolerated. Encouraging self-harm, suicide, \"bad karma,\" property damage, food tampering, or anything that wishes mental or physical pain on anyone, even hypothetically, is strictly prohibited. Violating this rule will result in a permanent ban.\n6. How To Post\nThe TITLE of your submission must begin with the acronym AITA or WIBTA (would I be the asshole?), then a description of the situation.\nPosts are limited to 3000 characters. Paragraphs are good; block text walls are bad. Format and punctuate your post reasonably. Be clear and concise. Don't link to screenshots or other subreddits. If you can't explain yourself in one post, without using external text pages, it does not belong here. Do not use someone else's account or a shared account.\n7. Post Interpersonal Conflicts\nPosts should be descriptions of recent interpersonal conflicts. Describe both sides in detail. Make it clear why you may be \"the asshole.\"\nSubmissions must contain a real-life conflict between you and at least one other person. They should not be about feelings, opinions, or desires. If your conflict is with a larger demographic, an animal, someone online, a business, or a third party who’s irrelevant to the main question but thought what you did sucked, your post will be removed.\n8. No Shitposts\nPosts must be truthful and presented as fairly and accurately as possible. Posts must be written entirely by you and from your own point of view. Do not post on behalf of others, or from the point of view of another person in the story.\nThis is not a humor sub. This isn't a sub for copypastas, satire, overly embellished stories, AI generated content, or creative writing exercises.\nShitposting will result in a permanent ban.\n9. Do Not Ask For Advice\nThis is NOT an advice sub. All submissions that ask for advice (instead of or in addition to judgment) will be removed. This sub is for arbitration.\nYou may include advice when you make your comments, but remember that your primary objective in commenting is to assign blame and pass judgment.\nIf a thread's focus becomes about advice instead of arbitration the thread may be removed regardless of the OP's intent.\n10. Updates and META posts are restricted\nPosts dedicated to discussing AITA should be directed to the monthly open forum. Any META posts will be removed & may result in a ban.\nUpdate posts require approval.  This includes any post that references another post, including posting the other perspective. Review the update criteria for more info. Unapproved updates will result in a ban.\nThis is not a saga or diary sub. Excessive posting will result in a warning or ban.\n11. No Partings/Relationship/Sex/Reproductive Autonomy Posts\nAITA is not a relationship sub. We do not allow the following types of posts:\n\nAITA for ghosting/cutting/reducing/denying contact with *anyone* (or not). \nAITA for liking/pursuing/dating/breaking up with someone (or not)\nAITA for doing a sexual act (or not)\nReproductive decisions (including adopting/fostering children and delivery room conflicts)\nPosts about cheating- including \"exposing\" someone's cheating (or not).\nOr similar conflicts that only exist in romantic or sexual relationships.\n\n12. This Is Not A Debate Sub\nIf judgment is primarily motivated by whether commenters agree with your stance on a broad issue it is not appropriate for this sub. This includes anything from politically motivated conflicts to innocuous issues like if cake is better than pie. If you're ultimately asking if it is okay to kick someone off your team for their sexual identity, stop talking to your friend because they vape, or any similar debate, your post will be removed.\nNo starting off topic debates about marginalized groups\n13. No Revenge Stories\nThere are many subreddits for sharing tales of revenge—this is not one of them. This is a sub for providing feedback on interpersonal conflict, not for endorsing how you escalate a conflict. If you're here to tell us how you punished someone who totally had it coming, you're probably breaking this rule.\n14. No Medical Conflicts\nAITA is a platform for moral judgment, not medical advice. The life and death consequences of many medical conflicts are well outside of Reddit's paygrade. We do not allow posts where the central conflict is transmitting or contracting any communicable disease, or undergoing any kind of medical procedure.\n15.

This Is Not A Debate Sub\nIf judgment is primarily motivated by whether commenters agree with your stance on a broad issue it is not appropriate for this sub. This includes anything from politically motivated conflicts to innocuous issues like if cake is better than pie.

No Revenge Stories\nThere are many subreddits for sharing tales of revenge—this is not one of them.

We do not allow the following types of posts:\n\nAITA for ghosting/cutting/reducing/denying contact with *anyone* (or not). \nAITA for liking/pursuing/dating/breaking up with someone (or not)\nAITA for doing a sexual act (or not)\nReproductive decisions (including adopting/fostering children and delivery room conflicts)\nPosts about cheating- including \"exposing\" someone's cheating (or not).\nOr similar conflicts that only exist in romantic or sexual relationships.\n\n12. This Is Not A Debate Sub\nIf judgment is primarily motivated by whether commenters agree with your stance on a broad issue it is not appropriate for this sub. This includes anything from politically motivated conflicts to innocuous issues like if cake is better than pie. If you're ultimately asking if it is okay to kick someone off your team for their sexual identity, stop talking to your friend because they vape, or any similar debate, your post will be removed.\nNo starting off topic debates about marginalized groups\n13. No Revenge Stories\nThere are many subreddits for sharing tales of revenge—this is not one of them. This is a sub for providing feedback on interpersonal conflict, not for endorsing how you escalate a conflict. If you're here to tell us how you punished someone who totally had it coming, you're probably breaking this rule.\n14. No Medical Conflicts\nAITA is a platform for moral judgment, not medical advice. The life and death consequences of many medical conflicts are well outside of Reddit's paygrade. We do not allow posts where the central conflict is transmitting or contracting any communicable disease, or undergoing any kind of medical procedure.\n15.

Be Civil\nAttack ideas, not people. The purpose of this sub is to determine and explain who is in the wrong, not to eviscerate anyone.

Derogatory or dehumanizing language, including insults, violate this rule.\nThis rule applies to everyone, even those not on Reddit. Don't insult others or get into prolonged spats in the comments. Don't lecture people about the rules (use reports).\nBe respectful. Be nice. Don't be an asshole.\n2. Voting Rules\nUpvote posts that make for an interesting discussion. DON'T downvote if you think OP is an asshole. DON'T DOWNVOTE COMMENTS YOU DISAGREE WITH. Downvotes should be reserved for off-topic discussions or spam. Report harassing comments, don’t engage. \nDon't participate in threads you have found through crossposts and links outside of this subreddit. In this sub, your comment is a vote. Brigading/Vote manipulation is against Reddit site wide rules. Violations will earn a permanent ban.\n3. Accept Your Judgment\nThis sub is here for the submitter to discover what everyone else thinks of the ethics or mores of a situation. It is not here to draw people into an argument you want to have, or to defend your position. If people start saying you were the asshole, do not take that as an invitation to debate them on the subject... accept the judgment and move on. If you have valid reason to think a commenter needs more information or misunderstood the facts of the conflict, you may give new information.\n4. Never Delete An Active Discussion\nDO NOT delete your submission once a discussion has begun. Your post must stay up for at least 48 hours. We encourage submitters to use throwaways to maintain their privacy, but deleting a discussion is unacceptable. Violators will be banned.\n5. No Violence\nDon't even mention violence.\nThe rule isn't about inciting or encouraging violence. It's about not mentioning.\nPosts or comments that reference or mention violence in any manner do not belong here. \nComments & even jokes about violence are not tolerated. Encouraging self-harm, suicide, \"bad karma,\" property damage, food tampering, or anything that wishes mental or physical pain on anyone, even hypothetically, is strictly prohibited. Violating this rule will result in a permanent ban.\n6. How To Post\nThe TITLE of your submission must begin with the acronym AITA or WIBTA (would I be the asshole?), then a description of the situation.\nPosts are limited to 3000 characters. Paragraphs are good; block text walls are bad. Format and punctuate your post reasonably. Be clear and concise. Don't link to screenshots or other subreddits. If you can't explain yourself in one post, without using external text pages, it does not belong here. Do not use someone else's account or a shared account.\n7. Post Interpersonal Conflicts\nPosts should be descriptions of recent interpersonal conflicts. Describe both sides in detail. Make it clear why you may be \"the asshole.\"\nSubmissions must contain a real-life conflict between you and at least one other person. They should not be about feelings, opinions, or desires. If your conflict is with a larger demographic, an animal, someone online, a business, or a third party who’s irrelevant to the main question but thought what you did sucked, your post will be removed.\n8. No Shitposts\nPosts must be truthful and presented as fairly and accurately as possible. Posts must be written entirely by you and from your own point of view. Do not post on behalf of others, or from the point of view of another person in the story.\nThis is not a humor sub. This isn't a sub for copypastas, satire, overly embellished stories, AI generated content, or creative writing exercises.\nShitposting will result in a permanent ban.\n9. Do Not Ask For Advice\nThis is NOT an advice sub. All submissions that ask for advice (instead of or in addition to judgment) will be removed. This sub is for arbitration.\nYou may include advice when you make your comments, but remember that your primary objective in commenting is to assign blame and pass judgment.\nIf a thread's focus becomes about advice instead of arbitration the thread may be removed regardless of the OP's intent.\n10. Updates and META posts are restricted\nPosts dedicated to discussing AITA should be directed to the monthly open forum.

Be Civil\nAttack ideas, not people. The purpose of this sub is to determine and explain who is in the wrong, not to eviscerate anyone. Treat others with respect while helping them grow through outside perspectives. Derogatory or dehumanizing language, including insults, violate this rule.\nThis rule applies to everyone, even those not on Reddit. Don't insult others or get into prolonged spats in the comments. Don't lecture people about the rules (use reports).\nBe respectful. Be nice. Don't be an asshole.\n2. Voting Rules\nUpvote posts that make for an interesting discussion. DON'T downvote if you think OP is an asshole. DON'T DOWNVOTE COMMENTS YOU DISAGREE WITH. Downvotes should be reserved for off-topic discussions or spam. Report harassing comments, don’t engage. \nDon't participate in threads you have found through crossposts and links outside of this subreddit. In this sub, your comment is a vote. Brigading/Vote manipulation is against Reddit site wide rules. Violations will earn a permanent ban.\n3. Accept Your Judgment\nThis sub is here for the submitter to discover what everyone else thinks of the ethics or mores of a situation. It is not here to draw people into an argument you want to have, or to defend your position. If people start saying you were the asshole, do not take that as an invitation to debate them on the subject... accept the judgment and move on. If you have valid reason to think a commenter needs more information or misunderstood the facts of the conflict, you may give new information.\n4. Never Delete An Active Discussion\nDO NOT delete your submission once a discussion has begun. Your post must stay up for at least 48 hours. We encourage submitters to use throwaways to maintain their privacy, but deleting a discussion is unacceptable. Violators will be banned.\n5. No Violence\nDon't even mention violence.\nThe rule isn't about inciting or encouraging violence. It's about not mentioning.\nPosts or comments that reference or mention violence in any manner do not belong here. \nComments & even jokes about violence are not tolerated. Encouraging self-harm, suicide, \"bad karma,\" property damage, food tampering, or anything that wishes mental or physical pain on anyone, even hypothetically, is strictly prohibited. Violating this rule will result in a permanent ban.\n6. How To Post\nThe TITLE of your submission must begin with the acronym AITA or WIBTA (would I be the asshole?), then a description of the situation.\nPosts are limited to 3000 characters. Paragraphs are good; block text walls are bad. Format and punctuate your post reasonably. Be clear and concise. Don't link to screenshots or other subreddits. If you can't explain yourself in one post, without using external text pages, it does not belong here. Do not use someone else's account or a shared account.\n7. Post Interpersonal Conflicts\nPosts should be descriptions of recent interpersonal conflicts. Describe both sides in detail. Make it clear why you may be \"the asshole.\"\nSubmissions must contain a real-life conflict between you and at least one other person. They should not be about feelings, opinions, or desires. If your conflict is with a larger demographic, an animal, someone online, a business, or a third party who’s irrelevant to the main question but thought what you did sucked, your post will be removed.\n8. No Shitposts\nPosts must be truthful and presented as fairly and accurately as possible. Posts must be written entirely by you and from your own point of view. Do not post on behalf of others, or from the point of view of another person in the story.\nThis is not a humor sub. This isn't a sub for copypastas, satire, overly embellished stories, AI generated content, or creative writing exercises.\nShitposting will result in a permanent ban.\n9. Do Not Ask For Advice\nThis is NOT an advice sub. All submissions that ask for advice (instead of or in addition to judgment) will be removed. This sub is for arbitration.\nYou may include advice when you make your comments, but remember that your primary objective in commenting is to assign blame and pass judgment.\nIf a thread's focus becomes about advice instead of arbitration the thread may be removed regardless of the OP's intent.\n10. Updates and META posts are restricted\nPosts dedicated to discussing AITA should be directed to the monthly open forum. Any META posts will be removed & may result in a ban.\nUpdate posts require approval.  This includes any post that references another post, including posting the other perspective. Review the update criteria for more info. Unapproved updates will result in a ban.\nThis is not a saga or diary sub. Excessive posting will result in a warning or ban.\n11. No Partings/Relationship/Sex/Reproductive Autonomy Posts\nAITA is not a relationship sub. We do not allow the following types of posts:\n\nAITA for ghosting/cutting/reducing/denying contact with *anyone* (or not). \nAITA for liking/pursuing/dating/breaking up with someone (or not)\nAITA for doing a sexual act (or not)\nReproductive decisions (including adopting/fostering children and delivery room conflicts)\nPosts about cheating- including \"exposing\" someone's cheating (or not).\nOr similar conflicts that only exist in romantic or sexual relationships.\n\n12. This Is Not A Debate Sub\nIf judgment is primarily motivated by whether commenters agree with your stance on a broad issue it is not appropriate for this sub. This includes anything from politically motivated conflicts to innocuous issues like if cake is better than pie. If you're ultimately asking if it is okay to kick someone off your team for their sexual identity, stop talking to your friend because they vape, or any similar debate, your post will be removed.\nNo starting off topic debates about marginalized groups\n13. No Revenge Stories\nThere are many subreddits for sharing tales of revenge—this is not one of them. This is a sub for providing feedback on interpersonal conflict, not for endorsing how you escalate a conflict. If you're here to tell us how you punished someone who totally had it coming, you're probably breaking this rule.\n14. No Medical Conflicts\nAITA is a platform for moral judgment, not medical advice. The life and death consequences of many medical conflicts are well outside of Reddit's paygrade. We do not allow posts where the central conflict is transmitting or contracting any communicable disease, or undergoing any kind of medical procedure.\n15.

Be Civil\nAttack ideas, not people. The purpose of this sub is to determine and explain who is in the wrong, not to eviscerate anyone. Treat others with respect while helping them grow through outside perspectives. Derogatory or dehumanizing language, including insults, violate this rule.\nThis rule applies to everyone, even those not on Reddit. Don't insult others or get into prolonged spats in the comments. Don't lecture people about the rules (use reports).\nBe respectful. Be nice. Don't be an asshole.\n2. Voting Rules\nUpvote posts that make for an interesting discussion. DON'T downvote if you think OP is an asshole. DON'T DOWNVOTE COMMENTS YOU DISAGREE WITH. Downvotes should be reserved for off-topic discussions or spam. Report harassing comments, don’t engage. \nDon't participate in threads you have found through crossposts and links outside of this subreddit. In this sub, your comment is a vote. Brigading/Vote manipulation is against Reddit site wide rules. Violations will earn a permanent ban.\n3. Accept Your Judgment\nThis sub is here for the submitter to discover what everyone else thinks of the ethics or mores of a situation. It is not here to draw people into an argument you want to have, or to defend your position. If people start saying you were the asshole, do not take that as an invitation to debate them on the subject... accept the judgment and move on. If you have valid reason to think a commenter needs more information or misunderstood the facts of the conflict, you may give new information.\n4. Never Delete An Active Discussion\nDO NOT delete your submission once a discussion has begun. Your post must stay up for at least 48 hours. We encourage submitters to use throwaways to maintain their privacy, but deleting a discussion is unacceptable. Violators will be banned.\n5. No Violence\nDon't even mention violence.\nThe rule isn't about inciting or encouraging violence. It's about not mentioning.\nPosts or comments that reference or mention violence in any manner do not belong here. \nComments & even jokes about violence are not tolerated. Encouraging self-harm, suicide, \"bad karma,\" property damage, food tampering, or anything that wishes mental or physical pain on anyone, even hypothetically, is strictly prohibited. Violating this rule will result in a permanent ban.\n6. How To Post\nThe TITLE of your submission must begin with the acronym AITA or WIBTA (would I be the asshole?), then a description of the situation.\nPosts are limited to 3000 characters. Paragraphs are good; block text walls are bad. Format and punctuate your post reasonably. Be clear and concise. Don't link to screenshots or other subreddits. If you can't explain yourself in one post, without using external text pages, it does not belong here. Do not use someone else's account or a shared account.\n7. Post Interpersonal Conflicts\nPosts should be descriptions of recent interpersonal conflicts. Describe both sides in detail. Make it clear why you may be \"the asshole.\"\nSubmissions must contain a real-life conflict between you and at least one other person. They should not be about feelings, opinions, or desires. If your conflict is with a larger demographic, an animal, someone online, a business, or a third party who’s irrelevant to the main question but thought what you did sucked, your post will be removed.\n8. No Shitposts\nPosts must be truthful and presented as fairly and accurately as possible. Posts must be written entirely by you and from your own point of view. Do not post on behalf of others, or from the point of view of another person in the story.\nThis is not a humor sub. This isn't a sub for copypastas, satire, overly embellished stories, AI generated content, or creative writing exercises.\nShitposting will result in a permanent ban.\n9. Do Not Ask For Advice\nThis is NOT an advice sub. All submissions that ask for advice (instead of or in addition to judgment) will be removed. This sub is for arbitration.\nYou may include advice when you make your comments, but remember that your primary objective in commenting is to assign blame and pass judgment.\nIf a thread's focus becomes about advice instead of arbitration the thread may be removed regardless of the OP's intent.\n10. Updates and META posts are restricted\nPosts dedicated to discussing AITA should be directed to the monthly open forum. Any META posts will be removed & may result in a ban.\nUpdate posts require approval.  This includes any post that references another post, including posting the other perspective. Review the update criteria for more info. Unapproved updates will result in a ban.\nThis is not a saga or diary sub. Excessive posting will result in a warning or ban.\n11. No Partings/Relationship/Sex/Reproductive Autonomy Posts\nAITA is not a relationship sub. We do not allow the following types of posts:\n\nAITA for ghosting/cutting/reducing/denying contact with *anyone* (or not). \nAITA for liking/pursuing/dating/breaking up with someone (or not)\nAITA for doing a sexual act (or not)\nReproductive decisions (including adopting/fostering children and delivery room conflicts)\nPosts about cheating- including \"exposing\" someone's cheating (or not).\nOr similar conflicts that only exist in romantic or sexual relationships.\n\n12. This Is Not A Debate Sub\nIf judgment is primarily motivated by whether commenters agree with your stance on a broad issue it is not appropriate for this sub. This includes anything from politically motivated conflicts to innocuous issues like if cake is better than pie. If you're ultimately asking if it is okay to kick someone off your team for their sexual identity, stop talking to your friend because they vape, or any similar debate, your post will be removed.\nNo starting off topic debates about marginalized groups\n13. No Revenge Stories\nThere are many subreddits for sharing tales of revenge—this is not one of them. This is a sub for providing feedback on interpersonal conflict, not for endorsing how you escalate a conflict. If you're here to tell us how you punished someone who totally had it coming, you're probably breaking this rule.\n14. No Medical Conflicts\nAITA is a platform for moral judgment, not medical advice. The life and death consequences of many medical conflicts are well outside of Reddit's paygrade. We do not allow posts where the central conflict is transmitting or contracting any communicable disease, or undergoing any kind of medical procedure.\n15.

Derogatory or dehumanizing language, including insults, violate this rule.\nThis rule applies to everyone, even those not on Reddit. Don't insult others or get into prolonged spats in the comments. Don't lecture people about the rules (use reports).\nBe respectful. Be nice. Don't be an asshole.\n2. Voting Rules\nUpvote posts that make for an interesting discussion. DON'T downvote if you think OP is an asshole. DON'T DOWNVOTE COMMENTS YOU DISAGREE WITH. Downvotes should be reserved for off-topic discussions or spam. Report harassing comments, don’t engage. \nDon't participate in threads you have found through crossposts and links outside of this subreddit. In this sub, your comment is a vote. Brigading/Vote manipulation is against Reddit site wide rules. Violations will earn a permanent ban.\n3. Accept Your Judgment\nThis sub is here for the submitter to discover what everyone else thinks of the ethics or mores of a situation. It is not here to draw people into an argument you want to have, or to defend your position. If people start saying you were the asshole, do not take that as an invitation to debate them on the subject... accept the judgment and move on. If you have valid reason to think a commenter needs more information or misunderstood the facts of the conflict, you may give new information.\n4. Never Delete An Active Discussion\nDO NOT delete your submission once a discussion has begun. Your post must stay up for at least 48 hours. We encourage submitters to use throwaways to maintain their privacy, but deleting a discussion is unacceptable. Violators will be banned.\n5. No Violence\nDon't even mention violence.\nThe rule isn't about inciting or encouraging violence. It's about not mentioning.\nPosts or comments that reference or mention violence in any manner do not belong here. \nComments & even jokes about violence are not tolerated. Encouraging self-harm, suicide, \"bad karma,\" property damage, food tampering, or anything that wishes mental or physical pain on anyone, even hypothetically, is strictly prohibited. Violating this rule will result in a permanent ban.\n6. How To Post\nThe TITLE of your submission must begin with the acronym AITA or WIBTA (would I be the asshole?), then a description of the situation.\nPosts are limited to 3000 characters. Paragraphs are good; block text walls are bad. Format and punctuate your post reasonably. Be clear and concise. Don't link to screenshots or other subreddits. If you can't explain yourself in one post, without using external text pages, it does not belong here. Do not use someone else's account or a shared account.\n7. Post Interpersonal Conflicts\nPosts should be descriptions of recent interpersonal conflicts. Describe both sides in detail. Make it clear why you may be \"the asshole.\"\nSubmissions must contain a real-life conflict between you and at least one other person. They should not be about feelings, opinions, or desires. If your conflict is with a larger demographic, an animal, someone online, a business, or a third party who’s irrelevant to the main question but thought what you did sucked, your post will be removed.\n8. No Shitposts\nPosts must be truthful and presented as fairly and accurately as possible. Posts must be written entirely by you and from your own point of view. Do not post on behalf of others, or from the point of view of another person in the story.\nThis is not a humor sub. This isn't a sub for copypastas, satire, overly embellished stories, AI generated content, or creative writing exercises.\nShitposting will result in a permanent ban.\n9. Do Not Ask For Advice\nThis is NOT an advice sub. All submissions that ask for advice (instead of or in addition to judgment) will be removed. This sub is for arbitration.\nYou may include advice when you make your comments, but remember that your primary objective in commenting is to assign blame and pass judgment.\nIf a thread's focus becomes about advice instead of arbitration the thread may be removed regardless of the OP's intent.\n10. Updates and META posts are restricted\nPosts dedicated to discussing AITA should be directed to the monthly open forum. Any META posts will be removed & may result in a ban.\nUpdate posts require approval.  This includes any post that references another post, including posting the other perspective. Review the update criteria for more info. Unapproved updates will result in a ban.\nThis is not a saga or diary sub. Excessive posting will result in a warning or ban.\n11. No Partings/Relationship/Sex/Reproductive Autonomy Posts\nAITA is not a relationship sub. We do not allow the following types of posts:\n\nAITA for ghosting/cutting/reducing/denying contact with *anyone* (or not). \nAITA for liking/pursuing/dating/breaking up with someone (or not)\nAITA for doing a sexual act (or not)\nReproductive decisions (including adopting/fostering children and delivery room conflicts)\nPosts about cheating- including \"exposing\" someone's cheating (or not).\nOr similar conflicts that only exist in romantic or sexual relationships.\n\n12. This Is Not A Debate Sub\nIf judgment is primarily motivated by whether commenters agree with your stance on a broad issue it is not appropriate for this sub. This includes anything from politically motivated conflicts to innocuous issues like if cake is better than pie. If you're ultimately asking if it is okay to kick someone off your team for their sexual identity, stop talking to your friend because they vape, or any similar debate, your post will be removed.\nNo starting off topic debates about marginalized groups\n13. No Revenge Stories\nThere are many subreddits for sharing tales of revenge—this is not one of them. This is a sub for providing feedback on interpersonal conflict, not for endorsing how you escalate a conflict. If you're here to tell us how you punished someone who totally had it coming, you're probably breaking this rule.\n14. No Medical Conflicts\nAITA is a platform for moral judgment, not medical advice. The life and death consequences of many medical conflicts are well outside of Reddit's paygrade. We do not allow posts where the central conflict is transmitting or contracting any communicable disease, or undergoing any kind of medical procedure.\n15.

Do Not Ask For Advice\nThis is NOT an advice sub. All submissions that ask for advice (instead of or in addition to judgment) will be removed.

How To Post\nThe TITLE of your submission must begin with the acronym AITA or WIBTA (would I be the asshole?), then a description of the situation.\nPosts are limited to 3000 characters. Paragraphs are good; block text walls are bad. Format and punctuate your post reasonably. Be clear and concise. Don't link to screenshots or other subreddits.

Be Civil\nAttack ideas, not people. The purpose of this sub is to determine and explain who is in the wrong, not to eviscerate anyone.

Derogatory or dehumanizing language, including insults, violate this rule.\nThis rule applies to everyone, even those not on Reddit. Don't insult others or get into prolonged spats in the comments. Don't lecture people about the rules (use reports).\nBe respectful. Be nice. Don't be an asshole.\n2. Voting Rules\nUpvote posts that make for an interesting discussion. DON'T downvote if you think OP is an asshole. DON'T DOWNVOTE COMMENTS YOU DISAGREE WITH. Downvotes should be reserved for off-topic discussions or spam. Report harassing comments, don’t engage. \nDon't participate in threads you have found through crossposts and links outside of this subreddit. In this sub, your comment is a vote. Brigading/Vote manipulation is against Reddit site wide rules. Violations will earn a permanent ban.\n3. Accept Your Judgment\nThis sub is here for the submitter to discover what everyone else thinks of the ethics or mores of a situation. It is not here to draw people into an argument you want to have, or to defend your position. If people start saying you were the asshole, do not take that as an invitation to debate them on the subject... accept the judgment and move on. If you have valid reason to think a commenter needs more information or misunderstood the facts of the conflict, you may give new information.\n4. Never Delete An Active Discussion\nDO NOT delete your submission once a discussion has begun. Your post must stay up for at least 48 hours. We encourage submitters to use throwaways to maintain their privacy, but deleting a discussion is unacceptable. Violators will be banned.\n5. No Violence\nDon't even mention violence.\nThe rule isn't about inciting or encouraging violence. It's about not mentioning.\nPosts or comments that reference or mention violence in any manner do not belong here. \nComments & even jokes about violence are not tolerated. Encouraging self-harm, suicide, \"bad karma,\" property damage, food tampering, or anything that wishes mental or physical pain on anyone, even hypothetically, is strictly prohibited. Violating this rule will result in a permanent ban.\n6. How To Post\nThe TITLE of your submission must begin with the acronym AITA or WIBTA (would I be the asshole?), then a description of the situation.\nPosts are limited to 3000 characters. Paragraphs are good; block text walls are bad. Format and punctuate your post reasonably. Be clear and concise. Don't link to screenshots or other subreddits. If you can't explain yourself in one post, without using external text pages, it does not belong here. Do not use someone else's account or a shared account.\n7. Post Interpersonal Conflicts\nPosts should be descriptions of recent interpersonal conflicts. Describe both sides in detail. Make it clear why you may be \"the asshole.\"\nSubmissions must contain a real-life conflict between you and at least one other person. They should not be about feelings, opinions, or desires. If your conflict is with a larger demographic, an animal, someone online, a business, or a third party who’s irrelevant to the main question but thought what you did sucked, your post will be removed.\n8. No Shitposts\nPosts must be truthful and presented as fairly and accurately as possible. Posts must be written entirely by you and from your own point of view. Do not post on behalf of others, or from the point of view of another person in the story.\nThis is not a humor sub. This isn't a sub for copypastas, satire, overly embellished stories, AI generated content, or creative writing exercises.\nShitposting will result in a permanent ban.\n9. Do Not Ask For Advice\nThis is NOT an advice sub. All submissions that ask for advice (instead of or in addition to judgment) will be removed. This sub is for arbitration.\nYou may include advice when you make your comments, but remember that your primary objective in commenting is to assign blame and pass judgment.\nIf a thread's focus becomes about advice instead of arbitration the thread may be removed regardless of the OP's intent.\n10. Updates and META posts are restricted\nPosts dedicated to discussing AITA should be directed to the monthly open forum. Any META posts will be removed & may result in a ban.\nUpdate posts require approval.  This includes any post that references another post, including posting the other perspective. Review the update criteria for more info. Unapproved updates will result in a ban.\nThis is not a saga or diary sub. Excessive posting will result in a warning or ban.\n11. No Partings/Relationship/Sex/Reproductive Autonomy Posts\nAITA is not a relationship sub. We do not allow the following types of posts:\n\nAITA for ghosting/cutting/reducing/denying contact with *anyone* (or not). \nAITA for liking/pursuing/dating/breaking up with someone (or not)\nAITA for doing a sexual act (or not)\nReproductive decisions (including adopting/fostering children and delivery room conflicts)\nPosts about cheating- including \"exposing\" someone's cheating (or not).\nOr similar conflicts that only exist in romantic or sexual relationships.\n\n12. This Is Not A Debate Sub\nIf judgment is primarily motivated by whether commenters agree with your stance on a broad issue it is not appropriate for this sub. This includes anything from politically motivated conflicts to innocuous issues like if cake is better than pie. If you're ultimately asking if it is okay to kick someone off your team for their sexual identity, stop talking to your friend because they vape, or any similar debate, your post will be removed.\nNo starting off topic debates about marginalized groups\n13. No Revenge Stories\nThere are many subreddits for sharing tales of revenge—this is not one of them. This is a sub for providing feedback on interpersonal conflict, not for endorsing how you escalate a conflict. If you're here to tell us how you punished someone who totally had it coming, you're probably breaking this rule.\n14. No Medical Conflicts\nAITA is a platform for moral judgment, not medical advice. The life and death consequences of many medical conflicts are well outside of Reddit's paygrade. We do not allow posts where the central conflict is transmitting or contracting any communicable disease, or undergoing any kind of medical procedure.\n15.

We encourage submitters to use throwaways to maintain their privacy, but deleting a discussion is unacceptable. Violators will be banned.\n5. No Violence\nDon't even mention violence.\nThe rule isn't about inciting or encouraging violence. It's about not mentioning.\nPosts or comments that reference or mention violence in any manner do not belong here. \nComments & even jokes about violence are not tolerated. Encouraging self-harm, suicide, \"bad karma,\" property damage, food tampering, or anything that wishes mental or physical pain on anyone, even hypothetically, is strictly prohibited. Violating this rule will result in a permanent ban.\n6. How To Post\nThe TITLE of your submission must begin with the acronym AITA or WIBTA (would I be the asshole?), then a description of the situation.\nPosts are limited to 3000 characters. Paragraphs are good; block text walls are bad. Format and punctuate your post reasonably. Be clear and concise. Don't link to screenshots or other subreddits. If you can't explain yourself in one post, without using external text pages, it does not belong here. Do not use someone else's account or a shared account.\n7. Post Interpersonal Conflicts\nPosts should be descriptions of recent interpersonal conflicts. Describe both sides in detail. Make it clear why you may be \"the asshole.\"\nSubmissions must contain a real-life conflict between you and at least one other person. They should not be about feelings, opinions, or desires. If your conflict is with a larger demographic, an animal, someone online, a business, or a third party who’s irrelevant to the main question but thought what you did sucked, your post will be removed.\n8. No Shitposts\nPosts must be truthful and presented as fairly and accurately as possible. Posts must be written entirely by you and from your own point of view. Do not post on behalf of others, or from the point of view of another person in the story.\nThis is not a humor sub. This isn't a sub for copypastas, satire, overly embellished stories, AI generated content, or creative writing exercises.\nShitposting will result in a permanent ban.\n9. Do Not Ask For Advice\nThis is NOT an advice sub. All submissions that ask for advice (instead of or in addition to judgment) will be removed. This sub is for arbitration.\nYou may include advice when you make your comments, but remember that your primary objective in commenting is to assign blame and pass judgment.\nIf a thread's focus becomes about advice instead of arbitration the thread may be removed regardless of the OP's intent.\n10. Updates and META posts are restricted\nPosts dedicated to discussing AITA should be directed to the monthly open forum. Any META posts will be removed & may result in a ban.\nUpdate posts require approval.  This includes any post that references another post, including posting the other perspective. Review the update criteria for more info. Unapproved updates will result in a ban.\nThis is not a saga or diary sub. Excessive posting will result in a warning or ban.\n11. No Partings/Relationship/Sex/Reproductive Autonomy Posts\nAITA is not a relationship sub. We do not allow the following types of posts:\n\nAITA for ghosting/cutting/reducing/denying contact with *anyone* (or not). \nAITA for liking/pursuing/dating/breaking up with someone (or not)\nAITA for doing a sexual act (or not)\nReproductive decisions (including adopting/fostering children and delivery room conflicts)\nPosts about cheating- including \"exposing\" someone's cheating (or not).\nOr similar conflicts that only exist in romantic or sexual relationships.\n\n12. This Is Not A Debate Sub\nIf judgment is primarily motivated by whether commenters agree with your stance on a broad issue it is not appropriate for this sub. This includes anything from politically motivated conflicts to innocuous issues like if cake is better than pie. If you're ultimately asking if it is okay to kick someone off your team for their sexual identity, stop talking to your friend because they vape, or any similar debate, your post will be removed.\nNo starting off topic debates about marginalized groups\n13. No Revenge Stories\nThere are many subreddits for sharing tales of revenge—this is not one of them. This is a sub for providing feedback on interpersonal conflict, not for endorsing how you escalate a conflict. If you're here to tell us how you punished someone who totally had it coming, you're probably breaking this rule.\n14. No Medical Conflicts\nAITA is a platform for moral judgment, not medical advice. The life and death consequences of many medical conflicts are well outside of Reddit's paygrade. We do not allow posts where the central conflict is transmitting or contracting any communicable disease, or undergoing any kind of medical procedure.\n15.

This Is Not A Debate Sub\nIf judgment is primarily motivated by whether commenters agree with your stance on a broad issue it is not appropriate for this sub. This includes anything from politically motivated conflicts to innocuous issues like if cake is better than pie.

Accept Your Judgment\nThis sub is here for the submitter to discover what everyone else thinks of the ethics or mores of a situation. It is not here to draw people into an argument you want to have, or to defend your position.

If you have valid reason to think a commenter needs more information or misunderstood the facts of the conflict, you may give new information.\n4. Never Delete An Active Discussion\nDO NOT delete your submission once a discussion has begun. Your post must stay up for at least 48 hours. We encourage submitters to use throwaways to maintain their privacy, but deleting a discussion is unacceptable. Violators will be banned.\n5.

Violating this rule will result in a permanent ban.\n6. How To Post\nThe TITLE of your submission must begin with the acronym AITA or WIBTA (would I be the asshole?), then a description of the situation.\nPosts are limited to 3000 characters. Paragraphs are good; block text walls are bad. Format and punctuate your post reasonably. Be clear and concise. Don't link to screenshots or other subreddits. If you can't explain yourself in one post, without using external text pages, it does not belong here. Do not use someone else's account or a shared account.\n7. Post Interpersonal Conflicts\nPosts should be descriptions of recent interpersonal conflicts. Describe both sides in detail. Make it clear why you may be \"the asshole.\"\nSubmissions must contain a real-life conflict between you and at least one other person. They should not be about feelings, opinions, or desires. If your conflict is with a larger demographic, an animal, someone online, a business, or a third party who’s irrelevant to the main question but thought what you did sucked, your post will be removed.\n8. No Shitposts\nPosts must be truthful and presented as fairly and accurately as possible. Posts must be written entirely by you and from your own point of view. Do not post on behalf of others, or from the point of view of another person in the story.\nThis is not a humor sub.

It is not here to draw people into an argument you want to have, or to defend your position.

If you have valid reason to think a commenter needs more information or misunderstood the facts of the conflict, you may give new information.\n4. Never Delete An Active Discussion\nDO NOT delete your submission once a discussion has begun. Your post must stay up for at least 48 hours. We encourage submitters to use throwaways to maintain their privacy, but deleting a discussion is unacceptable. Violators will be banned.\n5. No Violence\nDon't even mention violence.\nThe rule isn't about inciting or encouraging violence. It's about not mentioning.\nPosts or comments that reference or mention violence in any manner do not belong here. \nComments & even jokes about violence are not tolerated. Encouraging self-harm, suicide, \"bad karma,\" property damage, food tampering, or anything that wishes mental or physical pain on anyone, even hypothetically, is strictly prohibited. Violating this rule will result in a permanent ban.\n6. How To Post\nThe TITLE of your submission must begin with the acronym AITA or WIBTA (would I be the asshole?), then a description of the situation.\nPosts are limited to 3000 characters. Paragraphs are good; block text walls are bad. Format and punctuate your post reasonably. Be clear and concise. Don't link to screenshots or other subreddits. If you can't explain yourself in one post, without using external text pages, it does not belong here. Do not use someone else's account or a shared account.\n7. Post Interpersonal Conflicts\nPosts should be descriptions of recent interpersonal conflicts. Describe both sides in detail. Make it clear why you may be \"the asshole.\"\nSubmissions must contain a real-life conflict between you and at least one other person. They should not be about feelings, opinions, or desires. If your conflict is with a larger demographic, an animal, someone online, a business, or a third party who’s irrelevant to the main question but thought what you did sucked, your post will be removed.\n8. No Shitposts\nPosts must be truthful and presented as fairly and accurately as possible. Posts must be written entirely by you and from your own point of view. Do not post on behalf of others, or from the point of view of another person in the story.\nThis is not a humor sub. This isn't a sub for copypastas, satire, overly embellished stories, AI generated content, or creative writing exercises.\nShitposting will result in a permanent ban.\n9. Do Not Ask For Advice\nThis is NOT an advice sub. All submissions that ask for advice (instead of or in addition to judgment) will be removed. This sub is for arbitration.\nYou may include advice when you make your comments, but remember that your primary objective in commenting is to assign blame and pass judgment.\nIf a thread's focus becomes about advice instead of arbitration the thread may be removed regardless of the OP's intent.\n10. Updates and META posts are restricted\nPosts dedicated to discussing AITA should be directed to the monthly open forum. Any META posts will be removed & may result in a ban.\nUpdate posts require approval.  This includes any post that references another post, including posting the other perspective. Review the update criteria for more info. Unapproved updates will result in a ban.\nThis is not a saga or diary sub. Excessive posting will result in a warning or ban.\n11. No Partings/Relationship/Sex/Reproductive Autonomy Posts\nAITA is not a relationship sub. We do not allow the following types of posts:\n\nAITA for ghosting/cutting/reducing/denying contact with *anyone* (or not). \nAITA for liking/pursuing/dating/breaking up with someone (or not)\nAITA for doing a sexual act (or not)\nReproductive decisions (including adopting/fostering children and delivery room conflicts)\nPosts about cheating- including \"exposing\" someone's cheating (or not).\nOr similar conflicts that only exist in romantic or sexual relationships.\n\n12. This Is Not A Debate Sub\nIf judgment is primarily motivated by whether commenters agree with your stance on a broad issue it is not appropriate for this sub. This includes anything from politically motivated conflicts to innocuous issues like if cake is better than pie. If you're ultimately asking if it is okay to kick someone off your team for their sexual identity, stop talking to your friend because they vape, or any similar debate, your post will be removed.\nNo starting off topic debates about marginalized groups\n13. No Revenge Stories\nThere are many subreddits for sharing tales of revenge—this is not one of them. This is a sub for providing feedback on interpersonal conflict, not for endorsing how you escalate a conflict. If you're here to tell us how you punished someone who totally had it coming, you're probably breaking this rule.\n14. No Medical Conflicts\nAITA is a platform for moral judgment, not medical advice. The life and death consequences of many medical conflicts are well outside of Reddit's paygrade. We do not allow posts where the central conflict is transmitting or contracting any communicable disease, or undergoing any kind of medical procedure.\n15.

If your conflict is with a larger demographic, an animal, someone online, a business, or a third party who’s irrelevant to the main question but thought what you did sucked, your post will be removed.\n8. No Shitposts\nPosts must be truthful and presented as fairly and accurately as possible. Posts must be written entirely by you and from your own point of view. Do not post on behalf of others, or from the point of view of another person in the story.\nThis is not a humor sub. This isn't a sub for copypastas, satire, overly embellished stories, AI generated content, or creative writing exercises.\nShitposting will result in a permanent ban.\n9. Do Not Ask For Advice\nThis is NOT an advice sub. All submissions that ask for advice (instead of or in addition to judgment) will be removed. This sub is for arbitration.\nYou may include advice when you make your comments, but remember that your primary objective in commenting is to assign blame and pass judgment.\nIf a thread's focus becomes about advice instead of arbitration the thread may be removed regardless of the OP's intent.\n10. Updates and META posts are restricted\nPosts dedicated to discussing AITA should be directed to the monthly open forum. Any META posts will be removed & may result in a ban.\nUpdate posts require approval.  This includes any post that references another post, including posting the other perspective. Review the update criteria for more info. Unapproved updates will result in a ban.\nThis is not a saga or diary sub. Excessive posting will result in a warning or ban.\n11. No Partings/Relationship/Sex/Reproductive Autonomy Posts\nAITA is not a relationship sub. We do not allow the following types of posts:\n\nAITA for ghosting/cutting/reducing/denying contact with *anyone* (or not). \nAITA for liking/pursuing/dating/breaking up with someone (or not)\nAITA for doing a sexual act (or not)\nReproductive decisions (including adopting/fostering children and delivery room conflicts)\nPosts about cheating- including \"exposing\" someone's cheating (or not).\nOr similar conflicts that only exist in romantic or sexual relationships.\n\n12. This Is Not A Debate Sub\nIf judgment is primarily motivated by whether commenters agree with your stance on a broad issue it is not appropriate for this sub. This includes anything from politically motivated conflicts to innocuous issues like if cake is better than pie. If you're ultimately asking if it is okay to kick someone off your team for their sexual identity, stop talking to your friend because they vape, or any similar debate, your post will be removed.\nNo starting off topic debates about marginalized groups\n13. No Revenge Stories\nThere are many subreddits for sharing tales of revenge—this is not one of them. This is a sub for providing feedback on interpersonal conflict, not for endorsing how you escalate a conflict. If you're here to tell us how you punished someone who totally had it coming, you're probably breaking this rule.\n14. No Medical Conflicts\nAITA is a platform for moral judgment, not medical advice. The life and death consequences of many medical conflicts are well outside of Reddit's paygrade. We do not allow posts where the central conflict is transmitting or contracting any communicable disease, or undergoing any kind of medical procedure.\n15.

Be Civil\nAttack ideas, not people. The purpose of this sub is to determine and explain who is in the wrong, not to eviscerate anyone. Treat others with respect while helping them grow through outside perspectives. Derogatory or dehumanizing language, including insults, violate this rule.\nThis rule applies to everyone, even those not on Reddit. Don't insult others or get into prolonged spats in the comments. Don't lecture people about the rules (use reports).\nBe respectful. Be nice. Don't be an asshole.\n2. Voting Rules\nUpvote posts that make for an interesting discussion. DON'T downvote if you think OP is an asshole. DON'T DOWNVOTE COMMENTS YOU DISAGREE WITH. Downvotes should be reserved for off-topic discussions or spam. Report harassing comments, don’t engage. \nDon't participate in threads you have found through crossposts and links outside of this subreddit. In this sub, your comment is a vote. Brigading/Vote manipulation is against Reddit site wide rules. Violations will earn a permanent ban.\n3. Accept Your Judgment\nThis sub is here for the submitter to discover what everyone else thinks of the ethics or mores of a situation. It is not here to draw people into an argument you want to have, or to defend your position. If people start saying you were the asshole, do not take that as an invitation to debate them on the subject... accept the judgment and move on. If you have valid reason to think a commenter needs more information or misunderstood the facts of the conflict, you may give new information.\n4. Never Delete An Active Discussion\nDO NOT delete your submission once a discussion has begun. Your post must stay up for at least 48 hours. We encourage submitters to use throwaways to maintain their privacy, but deleting a discussion is unacceptable. Violators will be banned.\n5. No Violence\nDon't even mention violence.\nThe rule isn't about inciting or encouraging violence. It's about not mentioning.\nPosts or comments that reference or mention violence in any manner do not belong here. \nComments & even jokes about violence are not tolerated. Encouraging self-harm, suicide, \"bad karma,\" property damage, food tampering, or anything that wishes mental or physical pain on anyone, even hypothetically, is strictly prohibited. Violating this rule will result in a permanent ban.\n6. How To Post\nThe TITLE of your submission must begin with the acronym AITA or WIBTA (would I be the asshole?), then a description of the situation.\nPosts are limited to 3000 characters. Paragraphs are good; block text walls are bad. Format and punctuate your post reasonably. Be clear and concise. Don't link to screenshots or other subreddits. If you can't explain yourself in one post, without using external text pages, it does not belong here. Do not use someone else's account or a shared account.\n7. Post Interpersonal Conflicts\nPosts should be descriptions of recent interpersonal conflicts. Describe both sides in detail. Make it clear why you may be \"the asshole.\"\nSubmissions must contain a real-life conflict between you and at least one other person. They should not be about feelings, opinions, or desires. If your conflict is with a larger demographic, an animal, someone online, a business, or a third party who’s irrelevant to the main question but thought what you did sucked, your post will be removed.\n8. No Shitposts\nPosts must be truthful and presented as fairly and accurately as possible. Posts must be written entirely by you and from your own point of view. Do not post on behalf of others, or from the point of view of another person in the story.\nThis is not a humor sub. This isn't a sub for copypastas, satire, overly embellished stories, AI generated content, or creative writing exercises.\nShitposting will result in a permanent ban.\n9. Do Not Ask For Advice\nThis is NOT an advice sub. All submissions that ask for advice (instead of or in addition to judgment) will be removed. This sub is for arbitration.\nYou may include advice when you make your comments, but remember that your primary objective in commenting is to assign blame and pass judgment.\nIf a thread's focus becomes about advice instead of arbitration the thread may be removed regardless of the OP's intent.\n10. Updates and META posts are restricted\nPosts dedicated to discussing AITA should be directed to the monthly open forum. Any META posts will be removed & may result in a ban.\nUpdate posts require approval.  This includes any post that references another post, including posting the other perspective. Review the update criteria for more info. Unapproved updates will result in a ban.\nThis is not a saga or diary sub. Excessive posting will result in a warning or ban.\n11. No Partings/Relationship/Sex/Reproductive Autonomy Posts\nAITA is not a relationship sub. We do not allow the following types of posts:\n\nAITA for ghosting/cutting/reducing/denying contact with *anyone* (or not). \nAITA for liking/pursuing/dating/breaking up with someone (or not)\nAITA for doing a sexual act (or not)\nReproductive decisions (including adopting/fostering children and delivery room conflicts)\nPosts about cheating- including \"exposing\" someone's cheating (or not).\nOr similar conflicts that only exist in romantic or sexual relationships.\n\n12. This Is Not A Debate Sub\nIf judgment is primarily motivated by whether commenters agree with your stance on a broad issue it is not appropriate for this sub. This includes anything from politically motivated conflicts to innocuous issues like if cake is better than pie. If you're ultimately asking if it is okay to kick someone off your team for their sexual identity, stop talking to your friend because they vape, or any similar debate, your post will be removed.\nNo starting off topic debates about marginalized groups\n13. No Revenge Stories\nThere are many subreddits for sharing tales of revenge—this is not one of them. This is a sub for providing feedback on interpersonal conflict, not for endorsing how you escalate a conflict. If you're here to tell us how you punished someone who totally had it coming, you're probably breaking this rule.\n14. No Medical Conflicts\nAITA is a platform for moral judgment, not medical advice. The life and death consequences of many medical conflicts are well outside of Reddit's paygrade. We do not allow posts where the central conflict is transmitting or contracting any communicable disease, or undergoing any kind of medical procedure.\n15.

Derogatory or dehumanizing language, including insults, violate this rule.\nThis rule applies to everyone, even those not on Reddit. Don't insult others or get into prolonged spats in the comments. Don't lecture people about the rules (use reports).\nBe respectful. Be nice. Don't be an asshole.\n2. Voting Rules\nUpvote posts that make for an interesting discussion. DON'T downvote if you think OP is an asshole. DON'T DOWNVOTE COMMENTS YOU DISAGREE WITH. Downvotes should be reserved for off-topic discussions or spam. Report harassing comments, don’t engage. \nDon't participate in threads you have found through crossposts and links outside of this subreddit. In this sub, your comment is a vote. Brigading/Vote manipulation is against Reddit site wide rules. Violations will earn a permanent ban.\n3. Accept Your Judgment\nThis sub is here for the submitter to discover what everyone else thinks of the ethics or mores of a situation. It is not here to draw people into an argument you want to have, or to defend your position. If people start saying you were the asshole, do not take that as an invitation to debate them on the subject... accept the judgment and move on. If you have valid reason to think a commenter needs more information or misunderstood the facts of the conflict, you may give new information.\n4. Never Delete An Active Discussion\nDO NOT delete your submission once a discussion has begun. Your post must stay up for at least 48 hours. We encourage submitters to use throwaways to maintain their privacy, but deleting a discussion is unacceptable. Violators will be banned.\n5. No Violence\nDon't even mention violence.\nThe rule isn't about inciting or encouraging violence. It's about not mentioning.\nPosts or comments that reference or mention violence in any manner do not belong here. \nComments & even jokes about violence are not tolerated. Encouraging self-harm, suicide, \"bad karma,\" property damage, food tampering, or anything that wishes mental or physical pain on anyone, even hypothetically, is strictly prohibited. Violating this rule will result in a permanent ban.\n6. How To Post\nThe TITLE of your submission must begin with the acronym AITA or WIBTA (would I be the asshole?), then a description of the situation.\nPosts are limited to 3000 characters. Paragraphs are good; block text walls are bad. Format and punctuate your post reasonably. Be clear and concise. Don't link to screenshots or other subreddits. If you can't explain yourself in one post, without using external text pages, it does not belong here. Do not use someone else's account or a shared account.\n7. Post Interpersonal Conflicts\nPosts should be descriptions of recent interpersonal conflicts. Describe both sides in detail. Make it clear why you may be \"the asshole.\"\nSubmissions must contain a real-life conflict between you and at least one other person. They should not be about feelings, opinions, or desires. If your conflict is with a larger demographic, an animal, someone online, a business, or a third party who’s irrelevant to the main question but thought what you did sucked, your post will be removed.\n8. No Shitposts\nPosts must be truthful and presented as fairly and accurately as possible. Posts must be written entirely by you and from your own point of view. Do not post on behalf of others, or from the point of view of another person in the story.\nThis is not a humor sub. This isn't a sub for copypastas, satire, overly embellished stories, AI generated content, or creative writing exercises.\nShitposting will result in a permanent ban.\n9. Do Not Ask For Advice\nThis is NOT an advice sub. All submissions that ask for advice (instead of or in addition to judgment) will be removed. This sub is for arbitration.\nYou may include advice when you make your comments, but remember that your primary objective in commenting is to assign blame and pass judgment.\nIf a thread's focus becomes about advice instead of arbitration the thread may be removed regardless of the OP's intent.\n10. Updates and META posts are restricted\nPosts dedicated to discussing AITA should be directed to the monthly open forum. Any META posts will be removed & may result in a ban.\nUpdate posts require approval.  This includes any post that references another post, including posting the other perspective. Review the update criteria for more info. Unapproved updates will result in a ban.\nThis is not a saga or diary sub. Excessive posting will result in a warning or ban.\n11. No Partings/Relationship/Sex/Reproductive Autonomy Posts\nAITA is not a relationship sub. We do not allow the following types of posts:\n\nAITA for ghosting/cutting/reducing/denying contact with *anyone* (or not). \nAITA for liking/pursuing/dating/breaking up with someone (or not)\nAITA for doing a sexual act (or not)\nReproductive decisions (including adopting/fostering children and delivery room conflicts)\nPosts about cheating- including \"exposing\" someone's cheating (or not).\nOr similar conflicts that only exist in romantic or sexual relationships.\n\n12. This Is Not A Debate Sub\nIf judgment is primarily motivated by whether commenters agree with your stance on a broad issue it is not appropriate for this sub. This includes anything from politically motivated conflicts to innocuous issues like if cake is better than pie. If you're ultimately asking if it is okay to kick someone off your team for their sexual identity, stop talking to your friend because they vape, or any similar debate, your post will be removed.\nNo starting off topic debates about marginalized groups\n13. No Revenge Stories\nThere are many subreddits for sharing tales of revenge—this is not one of them. This is a sub for providing feedback on interpersonal conflict, not for endorsing how you escalate a conflict. If you're here to tell us how you punished someone who totally had it coming, you're probably breaking this rule.\n14. No Medical Conflicts\nAITA is a platform for moral judgment, not medical advice. The life and death consequences of many medical conflicts are well outside of Reddit's paygrade. We do not allow posts where the central conflict is transmitting or contracting any communicable disease, or undergoing any kind of medical procedure.\n15.
